# Methods to Reduce Point Consumption

- - - ### Methods to Reduce Point Consumption

      

      Having multiple dry orgasms can be tiring, making it difficult to enjoy them for extended periods. Therefore, to fully enjoy dry orgasms, it's crucial to minimize point consumption. By doing so, you can consistently have pleasurable dry orgasm sessions lasting over an hour or trigger several intense dry orgasms in a row.

      This chapter will introduce two methods that significantly reduce point consumption, as well as general methods that don't consume points. First, we will cover the **Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm** method, which also helps improve your overall constitution. Next, we will discuss the **Limit-Heat Dry Orgasm** method, which is very useful for enhancing your ability to maintain arousal and sensitivity.

      ### Experience Vicious Dry Orgasm Pleasure: Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm

      

      First, the Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm is a method where you endure an orgasm until you reach your absolute limit and then collapse into climax. By repeatedly enduring dry orgasms, you will become less likely to consume pleasure points, developing a constitution that doesn't easily get tired even after climaxing. The key is simply to endure to your limit, and this can be applied to any dry orgasm method. We will use nipple masturbation as an example to explain the specific steps, but once you understand it, you can apply it to other methods.

      This method can be a bit painful to endure at first, but the pleasure and results you get will be more than worth the effort, so push through it.

      **Steps for the Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm:**

      1. **Preparation:** Wear a thin shirt (for nipple masturbation).
      2. Touch the area around your nipples and moderately tease your whole body for about ten minutes.
      3. Perform nipple dry orgasm masturbation in a way that feels good to you. Gently stimulate yourself and, when you feel the climax building, proceed to the next step.
      4. Even though you want to climax, hold back while gently and continuously playing with your nipples. From here, maintain a constant level of stimulation. If you feel like you can't hold back, repeat the thought in your mind, "(I absolutely cannot climax... I can't climax)," and endure.
      5. The urge to climax intensifies, but you gently add more stimulation and continue to endure. Even as you tell yourself not to, the thought "I want to climax" becomes increasingly difficult to stop.
      6. Even when you feel you're at your limit, tell yourself to endure for another 30 seconds, pushing yourself further.
      7. After about 30 seconds, the urge to climax subsides slightly. If you feel you're at your limit again, repeat the process of enduring for another 30 seconds.
      8. Your rationality and normal thought processes gradually fade away. The thoughts "(I can't climax, I have to endure)" and "(I want to climax, I want to climax freely)" get mixed up and become increasingly chaotic.
      9. Despite your efforts to hold back, the pleasure of the dry orgasm will gradually escalate. Even as you keep telling yourself not to climax, the anticipation of climax will build uncontrollably.
      10. Even though you know you shouldn't, and you've endured to your limit, an intense dry orgasm suddenly erupts. "I can't... ♡ Ahhh ♡ Ahh~~~ ♡♡" Your voice becomes uncontrollable as the pleasure of the dry orgasm floods your entire body.
      11. Despite experiencing an intense dry orgasm, the feeling of consumption is very slight, and you can continue to climax.
      12. Change your stimulation technique and stop enduring. Fully enjoy the pleasure of the dry orgasm after the endurance, and climax freely.

      This is a method where you endure to your absolute limit and then climax in a way that feels like a collapse, even though you tried to suppress it with reason. Using this method not only makes the resulting dry orgasm more intense but also allows you to continue enjoying dry orgasm masturbation for a much longer time afterward.

      Although some parts may feel a bit painful, it is a highly effective training method that will make your body better at suppressing point consumption. Precisely because dry orgasms have the characteristic that "forcing yourself to climax can easily lead to fatigue and excessive point consumption," you should do the opposite: keep thinking, "I absolutely must not climax," and create a situation where you climax anyway. This allows you to have multiple orgasms without getting tired.

      This method can be used with any dry orgasm masturbation, so let's understand the key points for applying it.

      **Tips for Applying to Other Dry Orgasm Methods:**

      - Apply a weak (optional) stimulus, like filling a cup with water, gradually and continuously accumulating pleasure.
      - Repeat the words "I must not climax" or "I can't climax" in your mouth or mind.
      - When you're at your limit, endure for 10-30 seconds, and repeat this several times to extend the endurance time as much as possible.
      - Don't climax by your own will; endure until the orgasm overflows naturally.

      By repeatedly practicing the Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm, you can increase the time you spend enjoying intense dry orgasms and extend the total duration of your masturbation sessions, even when not following these specific steps.

      ### Staying in Heat Until Your Brain Boils: Limit-Heat Dry Orgasm

      

      The Collapse-Endurance Dry Orgasm is a technique that involves pushing yourself to your limit, while this method is one that doesn't.

      The key to this method is that if you can maintain continuous arousal, you'll not only feel better, but it will also be easier to have a dry orgasm with less consumption. Therefore, this can serve as training to extend the duration of arousal.

      This method is primarily used for nipple masturbation, and even those who are not very used to dry orgasms are likely to feel an intense pleasure, so you should definitely try it.

      **Steps for the Limit-Heat Dry Orgasm:**

      1. **Preparation:** Wear thin clothing.
      2. **Posture:** Lying on your back is recommended.
      3. (Optional) Thoroughly tease your entire body for about ten minutes to increase sensitivity.
      4. Absolutely do not touch your nipples. Instead, repeatedly use the **kalikali** method to touch the areola or use your fingers to draw circles and tease. At this time, it's easier to get aroused by imagining you're being teased by a mean girl.
      5. After about ten minutes, your body will slowly get hot and feel good, and the urge to touch your nipples will become increasingly strong.
      6. Gently pull on your areola with your fingers or rub your chest with your palm, adding variations to the stimulus from step 4 to further increase your desire to touch. You desperately want to touch your nipples, and your hips and legs start to tremble.
      7. Just the thought of touching your nipples makes your mind go blank. When you're near your limit, you can think or say out loud, "(Please touch me... ♡)" and continue to vigorously rub your areola. It's also very effective to do **kalikali** right in front of your nipples without touching them.
      8. You start to feel like you'd do anything to touch your nipples. You move your hips to make yourself feel better. You can't help but straighten your legs, and you feel like crying because you want to touch your nipples so badly.
      9. Just when you think you'll go crazy if you don't touch them, you tease yourself for about one more minute. You must endure this last minute with all your might.
      10. When your anticipation for your nipples is at its peak, use a super gentle and slow motion to lightly brush the tips of your nipples with your hand.
      11. An explosive pleasure is instantly generated. Your lower back trembles as you have a dry orgasm from your nipples. During the climax, continue to provide gentle but firm stimulation.
      12. Your whole body stiffens as you climax backward, and the long nipple dry orgasm ends. In most cases, it will end with a very long climax, but if you feel like you can climax again, intensify the stimulation and have another orgasm.

      By getting your nipples to this state of extreme heat, your brain will remember that "nipples can bring immense arousal," which can help maintain arousal during other dry orgasm sessions. This method can improve the duration and depth of arousal before a dry orgasm and can also solve situations where you inexplicably calm down during a climax.

      The Limit-Heat Dry Orgasm itself, while the climax time is shorter than the Collapse-Endurance method, gives you the intense sensation of a full-body spasmodic orgasm.

      There is also another version where you listen to audio instructions for nipple masturbation but absolutely do not touch your nipples. You only continue to tease your areola until the instruction for the final climax, at which point you finally touch your nipples. I have included some recommended audio tracks that can be used for reference.

      ### A Summary of Tips for Suppressing Point Consumption

      

      Based on my experience of having hundreds of dry orgasms, I've learned that certain conditions make it easier to consume points, while others don't. By suppressing the former and promoting the latter, you can enjoy dry orgasms for extended periods. Try applying these to your other dry orgasm methods.

      **Conditions and Methods that Easily Consume Dry Orgasm Points:**

      - Forcing yourself to climax.
      - Experiencing stimulation too intensely due to high sensitivity.
      - Strongly anticipating a climax.
      - Being distracted and unable to focus on the pleasure.

      **Conditions and Methods that Do Not Easily Consume Dry Orgasm Points:**

      - Using gentle touches or stimulation.
      - Enduring the pleasure.
      - Being in a state of intense arousal.
      - Fully focusing on the pleasure to the point of being oblivious to everything else.

      If you fulfill the conditions that make it easier to climax, and you prepare thoroughly before a dry orgasm session, you can easily achieve a higher-level dry orgasm without exhausting yourself.

      These may seem like minor details, but mastering them will allow you to achieve high-quality dry orgasms.
