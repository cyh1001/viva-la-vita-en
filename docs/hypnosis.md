# Introduction

Masturbation methods are diverse; while everyone's techniques may seem similar, each person has their own unique approach. Simply put, most people rely primarily on physical stimulation, with visual and auditory stimuli playing a secondary role. (For a few, it's the other way around, but we'll focus on the majority here.)

When masturbating, the physical sensation might not be the most intense at the beginning, but as you get closer to a climax, the physical pleasure usually becomes slightly stronger than the mental pleasure. This behavior is a biological instinct that allows us to focus on physical pleasure during a climax, but it can also cause us to neglect mental pleasure to some extent.

You've probably heard people say, "The best sex organ is the brain." While it's true that we can get a good amount of pleasure and arousal just from simple imagination, this doesn't fully utilize the brain's unique characteristics.

**Hypnotic masturbation** is a method that allows people to effectively use the brain's unique characteristics to obtain pleasure.

In hypnotic masturbation, a person is in a relatively calm and stable state. While it may not have the intense stimulation of a normal masturbation session approaching a climax, it is long-lasting and focused. You can focus on multiple senses and get stimulation and pleasure from several sensory levels. In turn, the resulting climax will be more intense and stimulating, possibly even far surpassing the sensations of regular masturbation.
