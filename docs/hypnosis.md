# Hypnosis: Introduction

There are various ways to masturbate. Each person's techniques may be similar in some ways, or perhaps each has their own different approaches. But simply put, in most cases, it's mainly physical stimulation, with visual, auditory and other stimuli as supplements (there are also a few people who do it the other way around, but here we will only discuss the majority of cases for now).

When masturbating, the body's sensations may not be the strongest at the beginning, but when approaching orgasm, the body's pleasure must be slightly stronger than the mental pleasure. This kind of behavior allows us to focus on the physical pleasure in the subsequent orgasm, which is our biological instinct. However, this instinct also causes us to more or less ignore the mental pleasure.

Everyone should often hear people say "The human body's best sexual organ is the brain." Indeed, just from simple imagination and conception, we can get good pleasure and make the body excited. But actually, this doesn't fully utilize the characteristics of the "brain."

Hypnotic masturbation is a method that allows people to better utilize the brain's characteristics to achieve pleasure.

In hypnotic masturbation, a person is in a relatively stable and calm state. Perhaps it doesn't have the intense stimulation of approaching orgasm during regular masturbation, but it excels in being lasting and focused. You can focus on multiple sensory aspects, you can get stimulation and pleasure from multiple sensory levels, and correspondingly, the orgasms it produces will also be more intense and stimulating, even far superior to ordinary masturbation methods.
