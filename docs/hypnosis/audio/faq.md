# Hypnosis Audio FAQ

Hey everyone! I'm Iria, a name taken from the heroine of a certain feminization hypnosis audio. The feeling of being in a feminization hypnosis trance is just fantastic!

There are many guides on using hypnotic audio online, so why am I reinventing the wheel? Well, most of the hypnosis guides I've seen are "instructional." They tell you what to do to get hypnotized, but rarely explain why, what not to do, and how to make it easier to enter a hypnotic state.

Because everyone is different, some people can quickly enjoy the pleasure of hypnotic audio, while others can never get into the state. But based on my experience and the information I've gathered, hypnosis is actually a very common state that almost everyone can enter. The reason for not being able to enter the state isn't usually because you don't know what to do, but because you're unknowingly overthinking it and doing many things you **shouldn't be doing.**

So, I want to create an "explanatory guide" that's better suited for beginners. It will help you find the shortest path to experiencing the beauty of hypnotic audio and avoid going in circles when you're just starting out.

As an introductory guide, it will mainly answer three questions:

- **How to enter a hypnotic state?** — How you should listen to hypnotic audio.
- **Why can't I enter a hypnotic state?** — It's not your fault you can't get into the state.
- **Why don't I feel anything after listening?** — Take your time, it doesn't take that long.

And a summary: TL;DR: It's too long, I don't want to read it.

And a personal recommendation for beginner hypnotic audio.

(This article is quite long, so feel free to jump to the questions you're interested in.)

So, let's start by answering the most common question about using hypnotic audio.

------



### How to Enter a Hypnotic State?



Just like other guides, the answer is simple:

Answer: Listen.

But here, I have another question:

How do you improve your academic performance?

Answer: Study.

...I'm sure you're not satisfied with that answer.

Just as learning and studying require certain skills, listening to hypnotic audio and getting into a hypnotic state also has some key points to pay attention to.

Ideally, if you can clear your mind, focus your attention on the audio, and not get distracted, you'll easily enter a hypnotic state. But in reality, due to differences in each person's constitution, mood, energy, and attention, some people have a hard time getting into the state, while others find it easy. What's the chance of an underachiever suddenly getting a perfect score on a test?

Therefore, I believe that for those who haven't taken the "How to Hypnotize" class, getting into the state is a matter of luck.

Let's go back to the question: How do you enter a hypnotic state?

I'll answer with an analogy: "Watching a movie."

When watching a movie, you use sight and sound to immerse yourself in the story. Hypnotic audio only uses sound.

This means:

- **Don't** deliberately try to imagine scenes.
- **Don't** deliberately try to put yourself in the shoes of the main character.
- **Don't** deliberately try to think about what you should be doing.

Just listen as if you're listening to a story.

You can't enjoy a movie when you're exhausted, so make sure you have enough energy.

You're not in the mood for a movie when you're anxious, so your emotional state is also important. Just be calm and free of distractions. Don't listen to hypnotic audio while waiting for a delivery or cooking.

Just like you'd enjoy a movie, relax, lie on a chair, and slowly watch the screen. When listening to hypnotic audio, relax, lie on your bed, and let the audio slowly guide you into a hypnotic state.

Now, I'll answer the second most common question:

------



### Why Can't I Enter a Hypnotic State?



I'll also ask another question:

Would you like "Blue Cat Rainbow Ranger" as much as you like "Your Name?"

You're a huge fan of Blue Cat? My apologies!

An audio that can easily get you into a hypnotic state needs:

- A topic you're interested in.
- A well-written script suitable for hypnosis.

The topic depends on your personal preference. As for a good script, for beginners, find one from a major publisher or ask for recommendations from experts.

In other words, if you encounter a topic you're not interested in or a poorly made script, it's not your fault that you can't get into the state.

The reality is that most scripts are poorly made. Many are labeled as hypnotic audio but are just for a quick climax.

But there are also many classic hypnotic audio files. Of course, hypnosis masters can turn a practical script into a hypnotic one, but we'll talk about that if we get the chance.

Here are a few qualities of a good script to help you choose the right audio for you:

1. It has a 20-40 minute induction section.

   It can be a little shorter, but anything over 40 minutes can be a burden on your energy. It's not recommended for newcomers. It's worth noting that some scripts use a natural induction method and don't have a clear induction section, but the effect is still good.

2. It doesn't have random sound effects.

   While many hypnosis performances have finger-snapping and clapping, for hypnotic audio, due to the lack of interaction, sounds like finger-snapping, clapping, sudden laughter, screaming, and a strong rhythm/melody in the background music are not suitable for hypnosis.

3. The instructions have a moderate amount of imagery.

   I once listened to an audio where the entire practical section only had "it feels so good" and "it's so enjoyable" as descriptions. On the other hand, I've also listened to some audio where there were too many descriptions at once: "Your breasts are being held, your left nipple is being played with by a finger, your right nipple is being sucked, your legs are being spread, a penis is going in and out of your pussy, a vibrator is in your ass, and you're moaning, 'ah-ung, ah-ung'..."

   Too many descriptions can be a mental burden and easily distract you, completely destroying the pleasure. For beginners, a single paragraph with stimulation instructions for one area is enough.

Finally, I'll answer the third most common question about using hypnotic audio:

------



### Why Don't I Feel Anything After Listening?



You have a suitable topic and a high-quality audio file, so why don't you feel anything?

The most pessimistic answer is that you're just not interested in the audio itself.

Just as some people have no interest in reading novels or watching anime, the medium of sound may not stimulate you enough to immerse yourself.

But if you enjoy other ASMR topics like ear teasing or bedtime stories, and are only indifferent to hypnosis, then I think there are some methods that can help you slowly fall in love with hypnotic audio.

In this case, both sensitivity and technique can be cultivated.

So, let's talk about how to gradually develop your sensitivity to hypnotic audio.

First, you can start with non-hypnotic audio that makes it easy to immerse yourself in the character's experience.

In this case, you can start with the topics you like and find works from major publishers. I personally recommend ear cleaning and ear licking because the sound effects are so good! The production quality of these all-ages audio files is usually better than R18 ones.

At this stage, you don't need any techniques. Just relax and listen. The key is to train your attention to sound, get used to receiving information through sound, and remember that feeling.

Then, you can start listening to hypnotic audio.

For beginners, I recommend audio with a short induction time and a short H-instruction section.

The key at this stage is to train your attention to the audio, specifically the induction and instructions.

The ideal state is to give up your active imagination and get the feeling of being led by the audio.

If you can easily grasp this feeling, you can usually enjoy the audio without any problems. So, when you're just starting, your main goal is to get into a hypnotic state during the induction section. Don't worry too much about whether you can get pleasure at this point.

Find a sense of immersion and engagement.

This state is essentially the same as reading a book and forgetting to turn the pages, feeling the imagery through the words. This is also the biggest difference between hypnotic audio and regular ASMR. It allows you to get an H-experience that is closer to a first-person perspective and accumulate pleasure.

Since this is an introductory guide, I'll stop here for now. Once you understand this sense of engagement, the next step is to practice how to maintain this state throughout the entire audio without "breaking character" (ending the trance).

### TL;DR



I've written 3,000 words, but this beginner's guide really just answers one question:

Where do I start with hypnotic audio?

The answer lies in three key points for beginners:

**Key Points for Beginners**

- **Find the right audio.**
- **Listen with your ears, relax, and don't deliberately do anything, including imagining.**
- **Take it one step at a time; both the hypnotic state and pleasure can be cultivated.**

Again, I recommend reading the full article to gain a better understanding. Humans are creatures who need to understand things, after all.

### Recommended and Not Recommended Audio



Works to improve your attention to sound for beginners:

I personally like:

- The "**ささやき庵**" (Sasayaki-an) series from the VOICE LOVER circle.
- Most of the works from theディーブルスト (Dīburusuto) circle.
- And any topic or work you like.

Works for practicing entering/maintaining a hypnotic state for beginners:

Note that these works may not be the ones that give you the pleasure of hypnotic audio, but I personally think they are suitable for beginner practice. There are generally three types of hypnotic induction:

1. Independent Induction

The first type is a separate induction section, with classic breathing, relaxation, deepening, and suggestion. These works first get you into a hypnotic state, and then the main H-suggestion begins. The characteristic is that there is a clear separation between the induction part and the H-part, and they don't interfere with each other.

Recommended works are:

- "**首枷**" (Kubikase) from the "暗中模索" (Anchu Mosaku) circle (RJ078337).

- "おもちゃ責め催眠" (Omocha-zeme Saimin) from the "Hypnotic_Yahn" circle (Free audio).

  This is also a work by Yahn, from 2011.

- Natural Induction

The second type is a natural induction. These works let you enter the scene and the hypnotic state along with the audio.

In fact, the dialogue and sound effects in ear-teasing and ear-licking audio are simplified versions of induction. They treat the listener as part of the audio's scene, allowing you to enter a hypnotic state without realizing it.

Recommended works are:

- "**ヒプノマルチボイス**" (Hypno Multi-Voice) and "**ヒプノマルチレイプ**" (Hypno Multi-Rape) from the "エロトランス" (Erotransu) circle (RJ190391). The first two works in this series are great for beginners. The third work, "**地獄級ヒプノマルチレイプ**" (Jigoku-kyū Hypno Multi-Rape) (RJ260463), is a bit more difficult.
- And "**女体化プログラム**" (Nyo-tai-ka Puroguramu) from "誠樹ふぁん／勇気化合物" (Seiki Fan/Yūki Kagōbutsu), which is known for its short length but great effect. It has an induction and pleasure section in just 12 minutes.
- Combined Induction

The third type is a combination of the two above. It lets you relax and deepen your trance while also giving you suggestions to enter the scene.

Many English hypnosis works use this method. I personally think this is a more mature induction method, as it's easier to maintain the hypnotic state throughout the entire audio, but the pleasure accumulation part may be a bit lacking.

Recommended works are:

- The "**朝倉催眠診療所**" (Asakura Saimin Shinryōjo) series from the "Es_Lab" circle and the "**MSIK**" and "**MSOT**" series.

- And the classic feminization hypnosis audio "リリーフレンズ" (Rīrīfurenzu) from the "キャットハウス" (Kyatto Hausu) circle (RJ061227).

  It may sound a bit messy and tedious today, but as a hypnosis classic, it's interesting to listen to. This work has many elements: TS, yuri, NTR, being NTR'd, domination, and more.

Please choose the introductory audio that suits your preferences.

Not Recommended Audio

I'll briefly mention a few circles that I really like but don't recommend for beginners:

- The "**Hypnotic_Yahn**" circle: Moderate-to-high difficulty. The style of each work is inconsistent, but a few have an excellent effect.
- The "**Kukuri**" circle: High difficulty. The works are story-driven, have great detail, are long, and are hard to get into the state.
- The "**風呂井戸ソフト**" (Furoido Sofuto) circle: High difficulty. The induction is weak, the works are long, and it's hard to get into the state.

And two absolute no-go areas: "百合虎魂" (Yuri Toratama) and "カジハラエム" (Kajihara Emu).

You guys have tried hard!

Actually, there are many good works out there. The recommendations above are based on my personal preferences, so please choose what you like. Whether it's feminization, SM, sisters, mothers, and childhood friends, or femboy BL and futanari, there's a hypnotic audio world out there for you.

I seem to have written too much. This beginner's guide actually doesn't cover that much.

Well, thank you for sticking with me this far. See you next time! In the next installment, I'll talk about some basic matters and techniques for hypnotic audio, which will be a step up from the basics. I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestions.
