### Goals and Methods for the Four Stages

This section can be used as a map when listening to hypnotic audio. Different hypnotic stages have different goals, and reaching a certain goal before moving to the next stage will make your hypnosis session smoother.

------



### Induction Stage



**Goals**

- Relax/sink your consciousness.
- Concentrate and guide your attention to stay on the audio.

In the induction stage, most of the audio's suggestions focus on relaxing and sinking your consciousness. Therefore, following the audio can help your consciousness sink.

The induction stage is the first step to entering a hypnotic state. In this stage, you should try to relax as much as possible and concentrate.

Relaxation includes both physical and mental relaxation. The preparation you do before hypnosis can make it easier for you to relax. The relaxation part is relatively easy to understand, so I won't go into detail. For many people, concentrating is the difficult part.

The simplest and most practical way to clear your mind and concentrate is through **breathing**. Diaphragmatic breathing is very useful, but here, Iria simplifies it into two types: conscious breathing and subconscious breathing (natural breathing).

- When you get distracted, use **conscious breathing**, focusing your attention on the actions of inhaling and exhaling while relaxing your body.
- When your mind clears up, use **natural breathing** and let your attention return to the audio.

If you have your own method, it will work even better. This method of using breathing to adjust your attention is actually derived from meditation. It may not be smooth at first, so please be a little persistent.

**Optional Reading: Two Common Problems in the Induction Stageâ€”Distractions and Falling Asleep Immediately**

Let's briefly discuss the two most common problems in the induction stage:

1. A scattered mind, many distractions/a lot of "noise" in your head.

2. Falling asleep while listening.

   This can be simplified to: you can't sink, or you sink too fast.

**Case 1:** It's only considered "noise" if you have more than three different distractions jumping around in your mind. If you only have one or two, you can refer to the section on how to concentrate.

First, before listening to hypnosis, do not do anything that is visually stimulating, such as watching anime, movies, or playing games. In general, anything that makes you excited before bed should be avoided.

What if you start listening to hypnosis with a calm mind but still find yourself thinking about distracting things?

Distractions/"noise" are a sign of a wandering mind. This means you are not yet familiar with hypnotic audio. Since audio doesn't provide direct visual stimulation, it's easy to get distracted. It's similar to not being able to focus on a book; your consciousness stays on the surface.

**Image:** Distractions and your active thinking to control them make your consciousness wander between being awake and being in a trance, making it difficult to sink.

If you always get distracted while listening to audio, it's recommended to start with non-hypnotic audio. You can refer to the introductory guide for this.

Also, you may have a constitution that makes you easily excitable, but since you are able to sleep every day, you shouldn't have any fundamental difficulty with hypnotic audio.

A basic process for reducing distractions is:

- **Step 1:** Relax your entire body: head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, torso, waist, thighs, calves, and feet. After relaxing once, observe/feel which parts of your body are tense again, and relax those parts one more time.
- **Step 2:** Breathe: Take a few deep breaths, then slowly transition to natural breathing.

Do not do both steps at the same time.

When relaxing and breathing, if the distractions are reduced to two, let your attention return to the audio. If your mind is still scattered, you can pause the audio and repeat the two steps above. I personally believe that too many distractions are mainly caused by too much stimulation before listening to the audio.

Occasional distraction is a very normal phenomenon and nothing to worry about. We get distracted when we watch movies, write, or do anything. Many times, we don't even notice it. For example, eating popcorn while watching a movie, or taking a sip of a drink while writing. Getting distracted is normal. You just need to refocus on the audio.

Iria herself deals with distractions by imagining the "noise" as an app on her phone. She then swipes up, and the app is closed. Alternatively, Iria listens to the audio while feeling the comfort of her pillow. The key is not to do this for too long and to pull her attention back to the audio in a timely manner.

You can also develop your own method. The key is to get familiar with the various situations you encounter while listening to audio and to accept them, because most of them are just normal phenomena (getting distracted is very normal!). Once you are familiar with the audio, you will be able to block out distractions more naturally.

**Case 2:** To avoid falling asleep immediately, you should have a certain level of energy before listening to the audio (this is important). However, it's not recommended to listen to the audio immediately after a nap, because your consciousness is naturally waking up, and it will be difficult to sink.

Listening to the audio one to two hours before your normal bedtime will generally ensure you have enough energy. If you still fall asleep immediately despite having enough energy, then the opposite of case 1 is true: you have a constitution that makes it easier to relax, and your consciousness sinks too quickly, making you prone to losing yourself.

In this situation, you can actively imagine some of the scenes in the audio or enter the deepening stage early. Begin imagining and constructing scenes and impressions to use your active consciousness to increase arousal and attention, which will prevent you from falling asleep.

------

**Optional Reading: On the Hypnotic Constitution**

Many people who feel nothing after listening to hypnotic audio think they don't have the right "constitution" to be hypnotized. Here's a brief explanation of what that means.

"Hypnosis" is not like what's described in movies or books, where you hand over 100% of your consciousness to the "hypnotist." But in a very deep state, you do feel like you're being led and are out of control. However, you still have a basic awareness that you can control your body... right?

A hypnotic state is essentially a state of high concentration that puts you in a state of immersion/trance/absorption. It's a state that everyone experiences every day, whether they're watching anime, movies, reading novels, driving, or eating sunflower seeds. Hypnosis simply changes this state from using visual and behavioral cues to using "listening and association," which are the acceptance of suggestions and imagination.

How does your constitution affect hypnosis? From the image above, you can see that a successful hypnosis session means your consciousness spends most of its time in the immersion zone, from being awake to being in a trance to losing yourself/falling asleep. But different constitutions and habits can make it difficult for you to enter the immersion zone or make you lose yourself too quickly.

In simple terms, the speed at which your consciousness moves up or down is too fast, making it difficult to control. But you can use some techniques to improve this and cultivate new habits to increase your sensitivity. Reading this guide may be a good way to do this.

From this perspective, using hypnotic audio to get pleasure is very similar to getting a prostate or nipple climax. It requires a lot of technique and attention to detail.

Iria believes that "can I be hypnotized?" is a false question. If you can be immersed in anime, movies, or novels, you can definitely enter a hypnotic state.

### Deepening Stage



**Goals**

- Deepen/maintain the state.
- Build a vague, simple self-**"impression."**

Building an "impression" is the foundation for getting pleasure. The deepening stage follows the induction stage, where you continue to sink your consciousness and build some basic imaginary content. Note that the deepening and induction stages have a lot of overlap; they are not separate stages.

In the deepening stage of the audio, you can still continue to relax and let your consciousness sink, depending on your state. Your attention should be mainly focused on the audio. Compared to the induction stage, you should have fewer active behaviors in this stage. At this stage, you should no longer get distracted or be bothered by noise in your mind.

In this stage, you can start building some image-based "impressions" through imagination.

Note that it's an "impression," which is a vague, hazy sense of an image, not a specific "graphic/picture." This hazy consciousness is more important than a specific picture. But you must maintain the depth of your consciousness. Therefore, do not over-imagine.

------

**What is an "Impression"?**

In hypnosis, Iria recommends that when you need to imagine something, you don't create a detailed picture in your mind. You only need a simple impression. It's like drawing a simple outline before adding details, or writing an outline before writing an article.

So, what is an impression? Let's take feminization hypnosis as an example.

**Image:** This image is a rough "impression" of yourself in feminization hypnosis.

Alternatively, you can stare at this image for one minute, then close your eyes. The parts that you can see in your mind are the "impression" of this image. It's vague, but you know what it depicts. You don't need to add details to this "impression."

In the deepening stage, you should create and maintain this "impression" in your mind and simply believe that "this is me." Do not actively add details. You can add details in the pleasure section when you are already at a certain depth and are highly concentrated.

You can also not add any details at all and just tell yourself, "This is me." The audio's suggestions and your brain will do the rest automatically.

The key is to be able to easily create this vague impression in your mind.

I'll say it again: **"Be vague, not detailed."** Do not rush.

In the later stages, when you're good at building a self-impression, you can add some elements from the audio, such as clothing and body shape. Otherwise, just follow the audio's suggestions and create the simplest impression you can.

The deepening stage is about making this impression the "**self in the audio's world**." This impression is your **"anchor point."** The anchor point is what you will use in the later **"pleasure stage"** to easily recall this impression. If you get out of the hypnotic state due to arousal or other reasons, you can quickly return to this anchor point.

Say it with me again: **"Be vague, not detailed."** (Annoying Iria)

In addition to your own "impression," the audio may sometimes guide you to create an "impression of the environment." Many audio files have environmental descriptions, such as in a train, a library, on a bed, or in a bathroom. Similar to the self-impression, you only need a rough "environmental impression" and then place your self-impression into this environmental impression.

This is roughly what you need to do in the deepening stage. You must maintain depth. If you don't have depth, you can choose not to create an impression. Instead, you can continue to let your consciousness sink and try to focus your attention on the audio.

You can adjust the level of detail of the impression based on your constitution, but you generally don't need to perfectly recreate all the suggestions in the audio.

Example from another blog:

"Porcelain-white, soft skin; silky black hair; large, shiny eyes; long eyelashes; a sharp chin; a sexy, charming collarbone; soft but firm breasts; a waist that looks like it would break with a little force; full, perky buttocks and toned legs that outline a beautiful curve; small, cute feet wrapped in over-the-knee socks."

It's very difficult and unnecessary to imagine such a complete impression during hypnosis. You don't need so many erotic spots to experience the pleasure of hypnosis. You can use the impression you have already built and, based on the suggestions above, strengthen the parts that are your **personal preference**, and you still don't need to be very detailed.

So the description can be simplified to: "**soft and firm breasts, thin legs wearing over-the-knee socks, and water-blue heeled sandals**" and then add it to your pre-existing impression.

That's right. You can add elements that you like and are not in the suggestions to your impression. But actively trying to imagine every part will only make your consciousness rise and make it difficult to get immersed. So, only add the content that you don't have to actively imagine.

------

**How to Judge Depth in the Deepening Stage**

I'll only share my own method for judging depth. Don't spend too much time judging your depth, because a single judgment will also decrease your depth.

Iria judges depth based on the vagueness of her body. For example, when you're awake, you can use your consciousness to feel a specific spot on your body, like three centimeters above your knee or the width of your thigh. But after your consciousness has sunk, the boundaries of your body become blurred, and you can't really feel these specific spots without concentrating. It's a feeling of being unable to determine the specific shape of your body.

It's strange to use "inability to judge" as a "judgment," isn't it?

**Optional Reading: Some References for Feminization Impression**

The impression a person has of their own body is very strong, so a different "impression" can be difficult to maintain in the beginning. Here, I'll share how Iria builds and maintains a "feminization impression" during hypnosis. The general idea is to strengthen the parts that are very different and give up on the parts that are similar, and to pay attention to the connecting points of change.

The parts that are important to distinguish are: the waist, the perineum (including the genitals), the chest, the calves, and the buttocks. The parts that you can give up on imagining and are very similar are: the head, neck, thighs, and eyes. Optional parts are: hair, eyelashes, chin, collarbone, shoulders, back, feet, the softness of the body, and the smoothness of the skin. The must-imagine parts are: any parts that you like.

The connecting points are the parts where these areas connect to other parts, the "line" where the change begins and ends. For example, the lower chest, the inner thighs, and the top of the knees (where the thigh narrows to the calf, which is roughly the top of the over-the-knee sock).

The parts that are very different are also impressions built step-by-step from the most obvious features, without needing to imagine details. The waist is emphasized for its thinness, and it becomes wider as it goes down. The chest is emphasized for its roundness. The buttocks are emphasized for their roundness from the waist, and their wider span. The calves are emphasized for their thinness from just above the knee. The perineum should have the feeling of the space between the inner thighs, after the buttocks have become wider.

Just maintain a blurry image.

**Two Exceptions to "Impression"**

Building an "impression" can make it easier to get immersed in the audio, especially in feminization hypnosis.

- **Exception 1:** For non-feminization audio, you can just use "your own impression of yourself" in the audio. You can strengthen the impression of other things in the audio, such as various tools or play, and the people in the audio. Based on Iria's experience, the combination of "self-impression" and "scene" is the easiest way to deepen the hypnotic trance.
- **Exception 2:** For men, if you're already very familiar with your feminized body, you can also use "your own impression of yourself" in the audio. But whether it's "your own impression of yourself" or a purely "built impression," you should try to experience the audio through the "impression" during hypnosis, not through the body lying on the bed.

### Practical Stage/Pleasure Accumulation



Pleasure accumulation and climax are not the main focus of this article, so I'll just touch on them briefly.

**Goals**

- Strengthen/expand/use the "impression."
- Accumulate pleasure and increase sensitivity.
- Climax: Release pleasure through "letting go."

When the "deepening stage" ends, you should have achieved these four goals: "relaxation," "a certain depth," "concentration," and "a stable impression."

- **Relaxation** allows you to reach a deeper state.
- **Depth** and **concentration** make it easier to accept suggestions.
- **Impression** is the foundation for enjoying hypnotic suggestions and can prevent you from "breaking character."

**Breaking character** generally means suddenly feeling a strong sense of your own existence, a strong sense of "**the real me**," rather than "**the me in the audio world**."

In the practical stage, you should still let your consciousness sink, stay relaxed, and concentrate on the audio. Then, you can interact with the audio through the "impression" to increase sensitivity and pleasure.

Don't worry, the pleasure you get through the "impression" will also be reflected in your own body, because at this point, the line between the "impression" and the "self" has become blurred.

Pleasure generally accumulates as the audio's suggestions progress. Here are just a few of Iria's personal insights from listening to the practical part:

First, don't "**expect**" pleasure. Instead, "**capture**" it. If you've developed your nipples or prostate, you may know what this means. The actual state is not to imagine/expect a stronger, **"specific pleasure,"** but to feel and capture the "**current**" sensation. In other words, you should maintain the excitement of the climax, but not imagine how your body will spasm during it.

Repeating the current pleasure can naturally make you feel better, but if the pleasure you imagined/expected doesn't happen, the pleasure will decrease. Active imagination and expectation will also make your consciousness rise, which reduces the effect of the audio's suggestions.

Let's use an example:

Let's say your pleasure is divided into 1-5 levels, each increasing in intensity.

Generally, from the beginning to the middle of the session, you will feel levels 1-3.

When you feel a rhythm with a lot of 1s and 2s, like 123221232111223..., don't expect a 3, and definitely not a 4 or 5.

When you feel a rhythm with a lot of 2s and 3s, like 233322233323333..., don't expect a 4 or 5.

When you get to a rhythm with a lot of 3s and 4s, like 2334443334443323444..., don't expect a 5.

In short, try to feel the pleasure you are currently getting and do not actively expect a stronger pleasure. At the same time, try to relax your body, which will make the pleasure more intense, but don't repeatedly remind yourself to relax.

Do you have a feeling of, "**So what am I supposed to do??**"

In fact, "just let it happen" is the best approach. But when pleasure comes, you will naturally want a stronger pleasure. However, "manipulating pleasure" generally only has a counter-effect. This is because "expecting pleasure" and "manipulating pleasure" are both active thoughts that should be avoided in hypnosis.

**"Relaxation," "depth," and "impression"** are still the main drivers for improving the hypnotic experience and increasing pleasure.

In the pleasure accumulation stage, you need to "**relax your body**," "**concentrate**" on the "**audio and pleasure**," and let the audio's suggestions play with your "**impression**." But let's leave the pleasure part for the next article.

**Optional Reading: Why can't I get a sense of an image no matter how hard I try?**

Some people may find that no matter how much they relax or imagine, they can't get a sense of an image. What should they do?

**Ta-da!** The answer is: **You don't need a sense of an image.**

I emphasized earlier that an "impression" is a vague feeling. In reality, this feeling doesn't even need to be an image. All you need is the "understanding that this is how it is." And the deeper your consciousness, the easier it is to get this feeling and, in turn, a sense of an image.

So, if you don't have a sense of an image or a sense of immersion, just keep deepening. Just like with "shooting a goal," the more you try to do it, the less likely you are to succeed.

Please deepen.

**Optional Reading: How to Find the G-Spot in the Vagina**

Ahem, this is a bit embarrassing to talk about. In feminization hypnosis, you can find some parts and organs that don't physically exist in your body. How should I put it? In hypnosis, these parts feel very vague, but you definitely have a sense of "that's it." For example, the feeling of a clitoris is different from a penis, but it's a bit similar to a glans, but the location where the pleasure is produced is different.

Ahem, so let's talk about how to find the G-spot. First, try to deepen the trance. If you've already found it after deepening, then you can stop reading.

After deepening, feel the vaginal opening above the anus. Then, imagine yourself using your finger to poke the vagina. In reality, make the corresponding finger move slightly as if it's inserting and poking. The movement should be so light that you don't even have to move.

As the finger slowly goes deeper and explores, a slightly sensitive spot will appear. It might feel a little itchy or like a slight electric shock. Some people say this is actually the location of the prostate. Is it?

You can use the same method to find the clitoris. Go up from the vaginal opening. There will be a slightly sensitive spot. At this point, imagine a fingertip teasing and rubbing it. Again, make a slight corresponding movement with your finger in reality. While rubbing, there will be a spot that is more sensitive than the others.

Alternatively, you can give yourself the suggestion that "the tip of my little finger is my clitoris," and then use another finger to gently touch it. The lighter, the better. Be careful to maintain the depth of your consciousness and not actively imagine the sensation; let the sensation appear on its own. After a while, the sensation from the tip of your little finger will be mapped to a spot on your perineum.

By the way, Iria saw this method in a published book on hypnosis! Reading really does make you happy.

### Hypnosis Awakening Section



There's not much technique involved here, but it's quite important. It's recommended to listen to it. Not listening won't have any bad consequences.

What? That's all?

As suggested by Hina-ai, the awakening section actually has another important purpose. First, in situations where you don't fall asleep after hypnosis, the awakening section can restore your mental clarity and remove the trance-like state. Second, in some hypnosis sessions, the awakening section has long-term suggestions that make your next hypnosis session better. So, you must listen to it!

The four stages above are the states of your body and may not necessarily correspond to the chapters of the audio. It's good if they do, but you should generally follow the order. There will be some overlap between the stages.

------



### Further Explanation of Depth



**"The Depth of Consciousness" and How Consciousness Changes During Hypnosis?**

Depth is a very comprehensive sensation. Giving up consciousness can give you a better depth, but once you reach a certain depth, you don't need to intentionally give up consciousness to let your consciousness sink and go deeper. It's not just relaxation, and it's not just concentration. During relaxation, your consciousness will naturally sink, but during concentration, it won't naturally rise. It will only rise when you actively think.

If we consider the direction of consciousness as a vector, then relaxation makes the direction go down, active thinking makes it go up, and concentration just makes you go straight in your current direction. It's a sense of propulsion.

The image below roughly explains what consciousness is. Your consciousness goes from being "**fully awake**" to being "**in a trance/absorbed**" to "**losing yourself/falling asleep**."

Generally, if you can keep your consciousness in the "in a trance/absorbed" state of high concentration, the hypnosis will be very effective.

The ideal state is like this:

**Image:**

But this is also fine:

**Image:**

Although the intervals of the three states in Iria's images look about the same size, the interval for the "in a trance/absorbed" state is actually very small, like this:

**Image:**

At least for Iria, it was very easy to fall out of the trance zone when she first started listening to hypnosis. Therefore, during hypnosis, it was very easy to be like this:

**Image:**

Well, as long as the trance interval makes up most of the session after the deepening stage, it's fine. The deepening stage should also start in the trance zone.

I'll emphasize this one more time: all **"conscious"** and *active* actions will cause consciousness to move upwards, which is what all of your *active* behaviors are.

For example, you realize that your depth is not enough, so you decide to relax your body and mind more. This realization itself will cause your consciousness to go up and become a little more awake. But the subsequent actions of relaxing and listening to the audio will make your consciousness go down. Therefore, if you keep *reminding* yourself to relax, relax, relax, relax, you will become more and more awake.

Also, when listening to audio, any change in thought is a form of active thinking. If the new thought is also an *active* action, it will cause your consciousness to climb up a lot. A series of such actions will make you completely awake.

For example, the description I mentioned before:

"Your breasts are being held, your left nipple is being played with by a finger, your right nipple is being sucked, your legs are being spread, a penis is going in and out of your pussy, a vibrator is in your ass, and you're moaning, 'ah-ung, ah-ung'..."

When faced with such a description that has too many details, I would only imagine one or two things, because the actual effect of this passage on consciousness is: imagining breasts, imagining the left nipple, imagining the right nipple, imagining the legs, imagining the pussy, imagining the ass, and imagining the sounds. This passage will make your consciousness rise a lot and easily disrupt the hypnotic state (the trance/immersion).
