### Entering and Maintaining a Hypnotic State



This is the second part of the hypnotic audio guide, a follow-up to the introductory guide, designed to help you enter a hypnotic state more consistently.

Let's review the three points from the introductory guide:

1. **Find the right audio.**
2. **Listen with your ears, relax, and don't deliberately do anything, including imagining.**
3. **Take it one step at a time; both the hypnotic state and pleasure can be cultivated.**

The three points in the introductory guide are enough to get you into a hypnotic state and enjoy the audio. If you haven't experienced hypnotic audio yet, please follow the introductory guide.

Also, hypnosis is not sleep and shouldn't make you fall asleep. Hypnosis is not audio you listen to while sleeping, and it's unlikely to give you erotic dreams or lucid dreams. For those who are new to hypnosis, there's no need to be wary of it. Hypnosis is just a work of art and won't control your mind like in movies.

If you've had some experience with hypnotic audio, you like it, but you still run into various problems while listening, then this article might help you.

Always remember the main guideline for consuming hypnotic audio:

**"Relax and listen" / "Listen with a calm mind" / "Focus your attention on the audio."**

These all mean the same thing. An excellent audio file only needs this guideline to solve all problems. I'll explain why below.

Unfortunately, most audio files are not that excellent. I hope that through this and subsequent guides, you can more consistently enjoy more audio.

As a foundational guide, I want to talk specifically about "**how to enter a hypnotic state faster and more consistently**" and "**how to maintain a hypnotic state/ensure the depth of the hypnosis**." I'll also touch on how to accumulate pleasure.

In essence, it's still an explanation of "**how to listen**."

After much thought, I've decided to write this guide in two parts. The first part will focus on concepts and logic, while the second part will focus on sensory experience. You can choose the parts you are interested in from the table of contents.

Please treat this guide as a map.

How do you use a map? You use it when you need it, you look for answers to your specific problems, you don't read it from beginning to end.

No one memorizes a map...

### Important Notes



**Warning**

If you can already consistently and stably enter a hypnotic state and enjoy the audio, then please do not read the parts of this guide that you are already familiar with. It is recommended to only use the table of contents to identify and read the parts you are least familiar with, or simply close this article entirely. The information in this guide may interfere with your existing hypnosis habits, causing you to unconsciously "think" during hypnosis, thereby reducing the effect.

If you have your own habits, methods, and understanding of how to listen to hypnotic audio, please follow your own familiar habits and methods and forget about the corresponding content in this guide.

For those who are new to hypnosis, Iria strongly recommends that you listen to about 10 hours of hypnosis before reading this content.

Always remember that a hypnotic state is easy to enter. This article simply breaks down and refines this state to help you understand it and the process of listening to hypnotic audio.

However, listening to hypnotic audio is mainly about finding one or more "**sensations**," not about "**understanding**" what hypnosis is or using "**theory**" to analyze an audio file. Everyone's "**sensation**" is unique, so you should follow your own feelings and grab onto them. Iria just hopes to point out some of the more important sensations to help you find them better and faster.

For example, for sensations like "**sinking**" or "**depth**," those who have experienced hypnosis probably understand what they feel like, but everyone's experience of this sensation is very different, so it's hard to tell you how to do it in just one article.

You have to grasp these sensations based on your own circumstances.

### Why Listen to Hypnotic Audio?



According to Iria's personal experience, hypnotic audio, especially feminization hypnosis audio, can give you a completely different kind of pleasure. M-themed hypnosis domination audio that doesn't require masturbation can also bring pleasure similar to feminization hypnosis audio, but Iria still prefers the feminization type.

Hypnotic audio can bring not only physical pleasure but also a sense of mental satisfaction. In a deep hypnotic state, hypnotic audio can create a certain kind of "**memory**" effect, which allows you to safely satisfy some of your unfulfilled desires psychologically.

For example, becoming a girl.

For example, being a girl.

For example, being a girl with a girl.

For example, being a girl with a boy.

For example, being a girl with a dog.

For example, being a dog.

Whatever you want and don't want, hypnosis can pretty much make it happen.

For those who identify as male and are preparing for a sex change through surgery or medication, feminization hypnosis audio can also be a great mental aid. It can provide a sense of satisfaction in a safe place, help you get used to receiving pleasure from inside your body, and shift your attention from your penis to your internal body. Or it can turn you into a submissive clitoris that can't get hard without internal climax, and it can help you achieve a female orgasm faster. In this case, hypnotic audio is more like a therapy.

------



### What Does a Feminization Hypnotic Climax Feel Like?



So, what does a climax brought on by hypnotic audio feel like? Iria's experiences of pleasure include:

- A feeling of **weakness in the lower back**.
- A slight **numbness in various parts of the body**.
- A clear **pleasure from the perineum**.
- **Shortness of breath** or even difficulty breathing, and a pounding heart.
- A feeling of a **low-frequency electrical massage** in various parts of the body.
- Spontaneous **shivering** or a feeling of an electrical current throughout the body.
- A feeling of the existence of the **G-spot, clitoris, vagina, and uterus**, which can also be slowly developed.
- A somewhat unpleasant, forcibly triggered pleasure.
- An inexplicable, even slightly frightening, uncontrollable pleasure originating from inside the body (the first time you feel this, the fear is stronger).
- Pleasure that surges from deep in the lower abdomen to the entire body, making you let out uncontrollable groans.
- The feeling of "going... going... going..." What does it feel like? It's the feeling of understanding that a girl can feel so good.
- The feeling of **being ejaculated into the uterus**.

All of these sensations are produced spontaneously by the body, so "**do not try to recreate these sensations through imagination**." You might even experience a pleasure that's different from Iria's, a pleasure that's even more addictive!

Note that the audio usually won't provide all of these experiences at once. I'll save some methods for accumulating pleasure for a later chapter.

### Pre-Hypnosis Preparation and Cautions



**Note:** The content in this section may not seem directly related to how to listen to hypnotic audio, but it has a huge impact on the quality of the hypnosis!

Before you lie on your bed and put on your headphones, there are a few things you can do to prepare, and a few things you should avoid.

**Friends of Hypnosis:**

- Showering/Bathing
- Stretching
- Writing

**Enemies of Hypnosis:**

- A full stomach
- Alcohol
- Fatigue
- A strong urge to urinate/thirst
- Noise
- A restless mind

Feel free to add your own to the list.

### Overview



**The Three Pillars of Hypnosis Quality:**

- **"Relaxation":** Everything starts with relaxation. It is the prerequisite for depth.
- **"Depth":** You need depth to accept suggestions. It is the prerequisite for immersion.
- **"Impression":** It is the anchor point for receiving suggestions and avoiding breaking the trance. It makes it easier to get pleasure.

**Stage-by-stage Goals:**

- **Introduction Stage:** Relaxation -> Deepening
- **Deepening Stage:** Deepening -> Impression
- **H-Stage:** Impression -> Pleasure -> Climax
- **Awakening Stage:** Awakening

That's it.

### Introduction



Based on Iria's years of experience with hypnosis/self-hypnosis, a successful hypnosis session is easier to achieve the less you think. In other words, **"giving up" thinking** during hypnosis can make the process smoother.

The main guideline for hypnotic audio is always "**focus on listening**," but this has some subtle meanings. For example: you shouldn't think about "**how to focus on listening**," and you shouldn't "**force yourself to focus on listening**" if you're distracted or can't focus.

Only listening to the audio can get you into a hypnotic state. To use the movie analogy again, imagine the feeling of being "immersed in a movie," and then turn that feeling into being "immersed in an audio file."

Here are some incorrect ways to give up thinking:

- Thinking about how to "**give up thinking**."
- "**Actively imagining**" the content described in the audio.
- "**Constantly imagining**" the content described in the audio.

To put it bluntly, "**thinking**" is the biggest reason you can't "**give up thinking**." However, the problem is that we often don't realize we are "**thinking**."

For example, when you have many distractions, you start to *think* about how to reduce them. When you hear a hypnotic suggestion, you start to *think* about what the suggestion is trying to describe. You *believe* that if you just force yourself to follow every suggestion, you can enter a hypnotic state. You feel at a loss when you suddenly lose the state and start to *think* about how to get back into it.

Iria hopes that this foundational guide will help you listen to hypnotic audio without trying to "**think**" as much as possible, but rather focus your attention more on the audio.

The ideal way to consume this foundational guide is to read it, understand it, and then forget it. Because thinking about how to listen to hypnosis is also a kind of thinking that is not helpful for hypnosis.

### Conceptual Part: The Three Elements of "Immersion"



This section is designed to help you understand the physical and mental state of listening to hypnotic audio. You don't need to understand this content to enjoy hypnosis.

What is hypnosis? There are many explanations online. Based on Iria's personal experience, the definition of hypnotic audio is: **"an experience similar to a dream, in a state of extreme physical relaxation and high concentration."** But it's not actually a dream. So, don't try to get into a dream state, and definitely don't fall asleep. Hypnosis is a very unique experience.

So, when we're listening to hypnotic audio or being hypnotized, what exactly are our minds and bodies doing?

Well, let's not overthink it. I'll use three analogies to give you a simple explanation. A high-quality hypnosis session is all about **"immersion."**

The following are the three important elements for increasing "immersion":

- **"Relaxation"**
- **"Depth"**
- **"Impression"**

If you understand this, then you don't need to read any further. When you listen to hypnosis, you're essentially strengthening these three elements. The relationship between them is roughly: relaxation promotes depth, depth promotes impression, impression leads to pleasure, and pleasure leads to a climax. We'll explain this in more detail later.

------



### How to Relax and Deepen the Trance



Let's first explain "**relaxation**" and "**depth**." These are the main goals of the induction and deepening stages, and they are the most important themes of hypnosis.

The most important theme. The most important theme. The most important theme.

**1. "Shooting a Goal" — Accepting Suggestions**

First, imagine a scene of a football player shooting a goal. Let's say successfully accepting a suggestion is scoring a goal. The ball is the instruction/suggestion in the audio, and your brain accepting/understanding/feeling this instruction/suggestion is scoring a goal.

So, all I have to do is shoot, right?

I believe that **"trying hard to accept suggestions" is the first pitfall for many people who listen to hypnosis.** The two main ways this happens are **"actively trying to visualize a single suggestion"** and **"actively trying to accept every suggestion."**

Why don't these two methods work for most people? Because during hypnosis, your consciousness is both the shooter and the goalkeeper. The more you try to accept a suggestion, the stronger your brain's resistance to it becomes. And your brain's ability to resist suggestions is much stronger than its ability to accept them.

So, how can you shoot the "suggestion" ball into the goal?

The answer is: **"Relax."**

First, relax your body. Use physical relaxation to promote mental relaxation. The more relaxed you are, the weaker your consciousness-goalkeeper becomes. The playing audio will then allow the suggestions to flow into your mind naturally. A goalkeeper who can't move much can be scored on easily, even by a child.

After relaxing your body, reduce conscious activity. What is conscious activity? It is all the mental activity where you actively try to understand, think, imagine, grasp, and manipulate things. In other words, any active behavior you do that is separate from the audio is conscious activity.

So, the key to accepting suggestions is to avoid doing anything "**actively**" as much as possible. You increase depth by giving up consciousness. However, there are still some things you can do actively, especially in the deepening and H-stages to build the "**impression**."

This explains why you should "**relax**" and the role of consciousness when accepting suggestions, but this is only one of the three key points of hypnosis. Please continue reading to get a comprehensive understanding of all three analogies.

**2. "Following" — Giving Up Thinking**

Analogy 1 explained one of the key points for better accepting suggestions. "**Following**" is another key point for better accepting suggestions. Following is a process that is mostly passive and a small part active.

The audio is your guide. When you follow, you should have a stage-by-stage goal. You should not run ahead of the audio by exceeding this goal. I'll tell you what the stage-by-stage goals are in the 4 stages of audio below.

If you just follow the audio with ease, you will eventually reach your final destination: pleasure and climax. You can adjust your distance from the audio-guide based on your state. Therefore, when listening to hypnotic audio, it's not necessary to tightly accept and imagine every suggestion, or even hear every word. It's perfectly fine to get a little distracted. Maintaining your own pace will make the entire hypnosis process smoother.

Just like you're very relaxed when you're following someone on a walk, when listening to hypnotic audio, you should also become more relaxed and think less during the induction and deepening stages. You don't have to and shouldn't follow the instructions to imagine/act on every suggestion, especially if you're not good at imagining or describing complex instructions, such as lifting your arm, having a blank mind, walking down a spiral staircase, and opening a large door.

**"Relaxing"** and **"giving up thinking"** to the point of not losing consciousness or falling asleep, and following the audio appropriately.

**3. "Diving" — Grasping Depth**

Finally, hypnosis is also similar to diving. When diving, you need to grasp the depth of the water. Too shallow is meaningless, but too deep can be dangerous—you'll get caught in the abyss of consciousness and "**lose yourself/fall asleep**." For most people, losing yourself means the end of hypnosis, but a good sleep is also very comfortable.

What is depth?

So, what exactly is the "**depth**" of hypnosis? First, let's go back to the concept of "**following**" in Analogy 2. When you listen to the audio, even though you really want to follow the audio's suggestions, your brain will initially refuse to follow and resist being suggested to.

After you relax your body and mind, your brain starts to accept the suggestions. The depth is the attraction of the suggestions to your brain.

Therefore, depth can be said to be the **"degree of giving up consciousness."** The sensation is a feeling of being "**sucked in**." Note that the feeling of being sucked in here is a passive one, while "**following**" is a more active process.

The analogy is the difference between "**being pulled along in a small car**" and "**driving and following**."

You can be pulled very tightly, but you should not drive and follow very tightly.

If you are sucked in more tightly by "**relaxation**," then you're more likely to fall asleep.

If you are sucked in more tightly by "**suggestion**," then you're more likely to enter hypnosis.

Similar to the feeling of being immersed when you watch anime, movies, or read novels, "**depth**" is the prerequisite for gaining "**immersion**" and "**hypnotic pleasure**." It's just a little harder to achieve this state with only sound than with sight.

Please note, as mentioned before, if you want to deepen your consciousness, do not imagine details or constantly imagine every suggestion. Also, don't try to think about sinking and sinking. Instead, try to slowly give up consciousness.

It's like when you're taking a test. Thinking "I must do well" doesn't actually make you do well. The key is the process of doing the test itself.

So, how do you make your consciousness sink and go deeper?

In other words, "how do you stop thinking?"

The answer is: under the premise of relaxation, concentrate on feeling things that don't require thinking.

This explanation may be too abstract. Let me tell you how Iria does it. It took me a while to grasp this feeling of not thinking.

"**Imagine myself on the surface of the water, and then slowly sinking**." This is a scene that Iria really likes. By continuously feeling this sinking sensation, distractions will decrease, and consciousness will go deeper.

Why does it take time to grasp this sensation? Because you need to practice this sensation to a point where it's like a muscle memory (even though it has nothing to do with muscles), where you can recreate this scene without thinking. It's like when you say "lemon," you naturally think of the scent and sourness of a lemon.

However, if you encounter a high-quality audio file in the induction/deepening stage, then focusing your attention on the audio is, of course, the best thing to do.

After you're proficient, the time it takes for your consciousness to sink again in a non-deepening stage is very short, and it won't affect the quality of listening to the audio. In fact, it will help you better accept the H-suggestions.

You don't have to imagine the same scene as Iria. Some people can even "sink" by imagining they're floating.

It's important to note that any active thinking, including imagining, will make your consciousness rise and lose some depth. In other words, the more you actively think (in detail) and the more frequently you do it, the more likely you are to lose the immersion of hypnosis. Conversely, relaxing and giving up thinking will make your consciousness sink, and the effect of the suggestions will be stronger, but at the cost of some suggestions slipping by. Generally, you don't have to constantly grasp the depth of your consciousness (and you shouldn't, because grasping the depth of consciousness is a form of active thinking). Just try to relax your body and mind, don't fall asleep, and keep your attention on the audio.

I hope the three analogies above at least answer these questions:

- Why can't I get into the state even though I follow the suggestions?
- Why do I get distracted easily?
- Why do I fall asleep?
- How do I relax?
- How do I accept suggestions?
- How do I concentrate?

Listening to hypnotic audio is not a completely passive process, but it's also not an active one. If you are naturally susceptible to suggestions and can maintain the depth of your consciousness, you will easily have a hypnotic experience. But if you're not, being a little bit active, by relaxing first and then deepening, can also get you into an ideal hypnotic state.

So, if you feel that you're not naturally susceptible to suggestions, you can use some of the methods in this guide to adjust your state to get a hypnotic experience. Listen to the audio with a *slight* "goal" in mind.

I hope I've explained it clearly. Feel free to ask questions.
