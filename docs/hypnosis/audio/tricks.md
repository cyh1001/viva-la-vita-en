### Quick Tips



Hey everyone, I'm Iria, a name from the heroine of a feminization hypnosis audio. I originally just used the character's name for a game, but after using it for a few months and listening to the audio again, I found that my sense of immersion had increased tenfold. So, I've stuck with the name ever since.

I've been listening to hypnotic audio for years and have always wanted to give something back to the community. I'm honored to have joined the "Beiniang & Hina-ai Telegram" group and am starting my contributions here.

I'll be sharing my personal hypnosis insights, especially about feminization hypnosis audio. Today, I'll start with some quick tips that I think are the easiest to put into practice.

First, some side notes and disclaimers:

- I personally believe that feminization hypnosis is more effective the younger you start, but based on my questionable moral standards, I do not recommend this for minors under 18.
- This article does not cover basic tips like relaxing your body, concentrating, and practicing imagination. I'll write a foundational guide based on your feedback.

### Tip 1: The Name Change



As I mentioned earlier, changing your online usernames to the name of the heroine in the audio. After a period of getting used to it, there's a chance your sense of immersion will skyrocket when you listen to the audio.

### Tip 2: Fake Blindfold



When listening to the audio, you can suggest to yourself that you are wearing a blindfold and can only rely on your ears to perceive the outside world.

You can say to yourself: "Oh, I can't see anything," or "My eyes are completely covered by a blindfold, and I can only listen to what she says."

You don't need to actually wear a blindfold. Just suggest it to yourself and let your ears become your only sensory organ. Give up your reliance on sight, relax, and let your hearing guide your subconscious.

### Tip 3: Almost-But-Not-Quite



For suggestions of physical contact in the audio, such as kissing or caressing, it can be difficult to imagine these actions directly, which can be mentally taxing and reduce your sense of immersion. In these cases, you can imagine a scene where you're almost touching. It's like a tease, where you're very close but there is no direct contact.

For example, for a French kiss, instead of imagining your tongues intertwined, you can imagine your tongues being very close, but just not touching.

### Tip 4: Body Heat



For suggestions of physical contact, it's easier to create a sense of immersion by imagining body heat than by imagining pressure. When you concentrate, your body temperature in the area of focus can increase due to blood flow and concentration.

### Tip 5: Oh, It's So Itchy... But It Feels So Good...



"Pleasure" is a difficult part of hypnosis to imagine and should not be deliberately imagined. Feminization audio is already difficult to get immersed in, and for men who cannot experience female pleasure, it takes a lot of practice to achieve this pleasure or climax through imagination.

So, for the feeling of "pleasure" (especially sexual pleasure), you can try substituting it with "itchiness." This isn't a violent itch, but a subtle itch like a mosquito bite or a feather tickle. It's an itch that can be imagined, a psychological itch that I'm sure we've all experienced.

For example, for a suggestion like "Oh, my pussy feels so good," you can substitute it with imagining a "thin, itchy sensation" in your lower abdomen or perineum. You can use this method for other parts of the body as well. Armpits, belly button, nipples, and kissing (imagine a subtle itch from the lips and tongue). Just imagine that the area is slightly itchy. Remember to follow the audio's prompts. Use the feeling of itchiness to accumulate pleasure.

I'll stop here for today.
