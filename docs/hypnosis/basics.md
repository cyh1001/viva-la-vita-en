# Hypnosis: Basic Knowledge of Hypnotic Masturbation

## Introduction

There are many ways to masturbate, and everyone's techniques may be similar or have their own unique differences; but simply put, in most cases, physical stimulation is the main focus, supplemented by visual, auditory and other stimulation (some people do it the other way around, but here we temporarily only discuss the majority of cases).

When masturbating, the physical sensations may not be the strongest at the beginning, but when approaching climax, the physical pleasure must be slightly stronger than the mental pleasure. This behavior allows us to focus on the physical pleasure in the subsequent climax, which is our biological instinct, but this instinct also causes us to more or less ignore the mental pleasure.

Everyone should often hear people say "The best sexual organ in the human body is the brain." Indeed, just from simple imagination and conception, we can get good pleasure and make the body excited, but this actually does not fully utilize the characteristics of the "brain".

Hypnotic masturbation is a method that allows people to better utilize the characteristics of the brain to obtain pleasure.

In hypnotic masturbation, people are in a relatively stable and calm state, perhaps without the intense stimulation of approaching climax during ordinary masturbation, but it excels in being lasting and focused. You can focus on multiple sensory aspects, obtaining stimulation and pleasure from multiple sensory levels, and correspondingly, the orgasms it produces will be more intense and stimulating, even far surpassing the feelings brought by ordinary masturbation methods.
