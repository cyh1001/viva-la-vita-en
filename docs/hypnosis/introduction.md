### Principles of Hypnosis





#### Basic Introduction to Hypnosis



The earliest origins of hypnosis are unknown, but from a medical perspective, modern hypnosis originated in 1843. The word's original meaning is "sleep" in Greek. Hypnosis studies the relationship between a person's conscious mind and subconscious mind, as well as how to trigger and transition between different states.

The main purpose of hypnosis is to induce a "trance" state to communicate with the subconscious mind, which is why hypnosis is also widely known as "subconscious communication."

Modern hypnosis is relatively widely used for psychological problems, hormonal disorders, neurological disorders, and other issues. It is also often used for healing purposes, such as mental relaxation, stress relief, and organizing thoughts.

Hypnosis corresponds to the human brain waves. Different brain waves correspond to different states and sensations, and can be roughly divided into four levels:

- **β-waves:** This is the most common state, occurring when people are awake. The brain waves are active, and the person's reactions are quick and sensitive. All sensations a person feels in the β-wave state come from the direct neural transmission of the five senses.
- **α-waves:** These are the brain waves that occur when people are sleeping. They also occur in some shallow dreams. The brain waves are stable, and reactions are slower and relatively dull. In the α-wave state, a person is relatively relaxed, and the five senses become simple and dull, or even difficult to perceive.
- **θ-waves:** These brain waves often occur when people enter deep dreams. The brain waves are further stabilized, and reactions are very slow, but the capacity for information is also relatively increased. Unlike α-waves, dreams here can feel real, and you can even perceive sensations through the five senses arranged by the brain that are not actually present (for example, you can taste and smell specific flavors, which is not possible in the α-wave state).
- **γ-waves:** This brain wave state is still difficult to confirm as absolutely existing. Only a few isolated cases suggest that this brain wave may exist, and it is difficult to reproduce in individuals. It is generally rarely discussed. According to research in psychology and neurosurgery, most hypnosis occurs in the α-wave state, which is a state that everyone can basically enter.



#### The Difference Between the Hypnotized State, Being Hypnotized, and Being Asleep



Being hypnotized is an uncommon state in daily life, and it is full of many misconceptions, especially from a lot of hypnosis-related works of fiction (laughs). For example, shaking a pocket watch in front of someone's eyes can hypnotize them, or a person staring at a crystal ball can be hypnotized, or simply looking at a certain image can be hypnotized.

But that is basically not possible, because hypnosis is mostly scientific (laughs). And it's not impossible to use pocket watches and crystal balls for hypnosis. Many people did this in the early days, but the universality and effectiveness are not particularly good. But the key is not what tools are used, but what the person says and how they say it. (If you are very skilled, you can even use a durian to hypnotize someone, just be careful not to hit yourself or others with it).

Another important misconception is that the hypnotized state is the same as the sleeping state.

In terms of brain waves alone, the brain waves of the two states are basically the same and do not have much difference. But people who are hypnotized can still communicate, which is usually not possible when they are asleep. So some scholars have suggested that hypnosis is a "shallow α-wave state," but this claim is still subject to debate.

Simply put, most people who are under hypnosis have a feeling similar to a "lucid dream." Their limbs feel weak or difficult to perceive, their breathing becomes calm, and their consciousness is hazy or blank. This is actually a state that people are in when they are "not sleeping very soundly" (which is why a poorly arranged script during hypnosis can easily wake a person up).

Of course, some people do not experience the states mentioned above, or the state is very short and difficult to catch. These people will have a hard time enjoying most common forms of hypnosis, but this does not mean they cannot be hypnotized.

### Categories and Characteristics of Hypnosis





#### Traditional Hypnosis (Academic Hypnosis)



This is the oldest school of hypnosis and the most widely circulated in the world. It was often used in ancient divination, theological activities, and shamanic healing. Most students who study psychology or mental health-related fields learn this type of hypnosis.

- **Pros:** It is a common, stable, clear, relatively safe, and versatile form of hypnosis. It has strong universality and can be used in various media, such as audio, video, and images. There are many references and documents available, and it is relatively simple to learn. It is often used in various psychological and mental therapies and is widely accepted.
- **Cons:** It has certain requirements for the environment and the relationship between the subject and the hypnotist, as well as the level of trust. The initial induction process is long, and the hypnotist needs to constantly verify the subject's state during the hypnosis. The subject must also remain relatively still and not move at will. A single session usually lasts more than an hour. It is difficult to perform on people with difficult conditions or those who are hard to communicate with, and other methods need to be introduced. In some cases, the hypnotist can be led astray by the patient.



#### Stage Hypnosis (Performance Hypnosis)



This type of hypnosis originated around the time of the First Industrial Revolution. Starting in the 1930s, it was widely used in various circuses, stage shows, and magic performances, hence the name performance hypnosis. This school of hypnosis is known for its flamboyant techniques and astonishing performances.

Stage hypnosis has also been used to treat some psychological and mental illnesses, such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), ADHD (Attention Deficit Disorder), and congenital conditions like autism, and has achieved some success.

- **Pros:** It does not require the environment, trust, and preparation of traditional hypnosis. It can quickly influence the subject and communicate with their subconscious. The induction speed is very fast, and the hypnotist can even get the subject into a hypnotic state in a few seconds without them knowing.
- **Cons:** It requires a lot of practice. The requirements for the hypnotist are extremely high, and the requirements for the subject are also very high, which is why stage hypnotists have a screening process. Performance hypnosis also has certain scene requirements and usually requires the attention of at least three or more people (not including the hypnotist and the subject). The ability to control the number of people depends entirely on the hypnotist's personal ability, which is part of the reason why this type of hypnosis is slowly fading and fewer people are learning it.



#### Neuro-Linguistic Hypnosis (NLP)



Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) hypnosis, also known as neurolinguistic hypnosis/therapy, originated in the late 20th century. It is a new discipline and school of thought created by mixing modern psychology, linguistics, and programming knowledge.

The emergence of NLP hypnosis has solved many difficult psychological and mental problems, and the methods are more novel and the effects are more obvious.

The biggest feature of NLP hypnosis is that it can get the subject into a state relatively quickly and is conducted in a relatively normal conversational format, rather than the serious and rigid state of traditional hypnosis. It also doesn't have many requirements for the scene or environment; it just needs to be an environment where it's not easy to be disturbed.

Since its invention, NLP has been widely used in the field of clinical therapy.

- **Pros:** The induction process is fast, simple, and light, which makes it easier for the subject to enter the state comfortably. A single session does not need to be very long to have a significant effect. The hypnotist can give suggestions and guide the subconscious while the subject is fully awake, and the subject may not even know they have been hypnotized, which can effectively reduce the subject's nervousness.
- **Cons:** It involves too many fields, and the knowledge required is very complex. In addition to a lot of knowledge, it requires a lot from the hypnotist's personal language expression, pre-rehearsal, and depth of understanding. And there are basically no references or experiences to draw from when encountering problems; the hypnotist must come up with and experiment with solutions themselves. It also requires the hypnotist to have good improvisation skills.

**Summary:** The vast majority of existing hypnotic audio is in the form of traditional hypnosis, and most of it is not made by professionals in the field, so there are some problems with it. This requires the listener to do more things, such as understanding how to listen and what to pay attention to, and in this process, find the method and posture that suits them. After all, everyone's psychology has more or less differences. By better understanding yourself, you can better enjoy the pleasure that your body and mind can bring.

Before deciding to listen, you might want to take a test to see how receptive you are. It's not too late to decide after that.
