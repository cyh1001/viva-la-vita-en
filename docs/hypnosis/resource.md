### Hypnotic and Audio Resource Acquisition



Here are some resources for finding hypnotic and ASMR audio.

------



### Resource Aggregator Websites



These sites collect and archive audio resources. They are like a library, with many authors and their works, but they may not have a complete collection of every work. These sites are constantly updated with new and old resources.

- ASMR基佬中心 (ASMR Gay Center): https://www.asmrgay.com/ or https://asmr.pw. If the original URL is down, you can find the new one at https://asmrgay.eu.org.

  This site has a wide and extensive collection of Chinese audio resources, including many hypnotic audios from creators like "小野猫" (Little Wildcat) and "步非烟" (Bu Feiyan). It also features many translated Japanese resources (with translated scripts), as well as original Japanese audio files sold on DLsite. You can search for these using lists and RJ numbers. Finally, there are some audio recordings and videos. The site is free and popular, so it may not be very stable. It's recommended to download files rather than streaming them. The site has its own Telegram group.

- ASMR Online: https://www.asmr.one/works

  This site mainly collects Japanese audio, with a small number of Chinese resources. The collection is very comprehensive, and most files are original. You can find most of the audios sold on DLsite here and listen to them for free (you need to use Google Chrome to download). The site provides a link to the DLsite page, where you can view product descriptions and reviews. Unlike ASMR基佬中心, you can register for an account to save and comment on works. Since it has audio covers and tags and allows you to browse all the original content, it's better for discovering new works based on your preferences. The site also has a Telegram group.

- Japanese ASMR: [可疑链接已删除]

  The purpose and function of this site are similar to the ones above, but its resources are not original. This means it only has audio files, no videos or images, and the audio files are often merged. A Japanese hypnotic audio might be separated into five files—induction, deepening, accumulation, release, and awakening—each lasting about 10 minutes. On this site, they would be merged into a single 1- to 2-hour file. Of course, if an audio has two versions, it will be saved as two separate files. The website interface is in English.

### Forum-style Websites



Unlike the resource aggregator sites above, these are forums for members to interact and discuss, including but not limited to asking for resources, sharing resources, and discussing experiences. The discussions are diverse, so the resources are also varied. They are shared by forum members, not curated by a dedicated team. Finding a specific resource depends on whether a user has shared it. The advantage is that you can sometimes find comprehensive resource collections or personal purchases shared by experienced users.

- 南+论坛 (South+ Forum): https://south-plus.org/

  The website is comprehensive and stable, with discussion areas and resource sharing. The downside is that registration is not always open, and you need a VPN to access it. The homepage of the PC version has a list of other similar forums at the bottom, such as "琉璃神社" (Ruri Shrine) and "绅士之庭" (Gentleman's Garden). Their functions are similar, but I haven't used them, so I won't list them here. You can check them out yourself.

- 哔哩哔哩 (Bilibili): https://www.bilibili.com/

  This site contains a certain number of all-ages Chinese hypnotic audios. The production and professional level of some of them are higher than the R18 Chinese hypnosis from creators like "小野猫" and "步非烟," making them a good choice for beginners. (Be careful to distinguish them from sleep-aid or story-based audios. Recommended search keywords are: 催眠音声 or "hypnotic audio").

### Japanese Audio Sales Website



- DLsite:[https://dlsite.com](https://dlsite.com/)

  This site has a very comprehensive collection of Japanese audio. If you see something you like on one of the free sites but aren't sure about the content, you can search for it here to get detailed product information from the creator. If you see something you like on DLsite, you can then search for it on one of the free sites mentioned above. If you still can't find it, you can try the South+ Forum to see if a generous user has shared a personal purchase. If all else fails, you can buy it.

  (If you have some spare money and really like a specific audio, consider purchasing it to support the creator and encourage them to make more and better works.)
