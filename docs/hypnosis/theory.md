# Hypnosis: Theory of Hypnotic Masturbation

### Principles of Hypnotic Masturbation

### Types of Hypnotic Masturbation Audio



1. Guided Hypnotic Masturbation Audio

   Guided hypnosis audio requires the listener to perform the masturbatory actions themselves. The audio's role is primarily to provide supplementary stimulation, and in essence, there is no difference between it and most ASMR content. The only reason it has this name is because it includes some hypnotic content, but most works of this type would be unaffected if the hypnotic elements were removed. In this type of audio, hypnosis mainly serves to help the listener focus and relax while listening.

   Essentially, it is not much different from ordinary erotic audio. Its advantage is that it is very easy to get started with, and most people can easily accept it. The disadvantage is that it lacks strong immersion and has little long-term value.

2. Scenario-Based Hypnotic Masturbation Audio

   Scenario-based hypnotic masturbation audio includes: providing the listener with a setting, a story/scenario premise, or some form of interaction. All of these can be considered scenario-based hypnotic audio.

   The characteristic of this type of audio is that it mostly uses the methods of traditional hypnosis, and the listener is not required to actively do anything during the session. The climax achieved is usually a non-contact orgasm.

   The advantage of this type of audio is that it provides better immersion and a more profound/intense pleasure than a regular climax. The disadvantage is that it has a certain barrier to entry. Most of these audio files are in English and Japanese, and the listener needs a certain level of foreign language proficiency. Even with a text translation, the effect is significantly diminished. At the same time, it places high demands on the listener's physical sensitivity, hypnotic receptivity, and physical development.

   Note: The word "scenario" in scenario-based hypnotic masturbation audio actually refers to the scenario hypnosis technique in traditional hypnosis. Not all scenario hypnosis can be used for hypnotic masturbation. For example, the well-known "Bambi Sleep" is a development-based hypnotic audio. It is easy to differentiate: just see if the core purpose is hypnotic masturbation/hypnotic masturbation climax. If so, it is scenario-based hypnotic masturbation audio. Hypnotic masturbation audio also doesn't require the listener to listen repeatedly for a long time, but development-based audio does. So, please identify and choose according to your actual situation.

### How Hypnotic Masturbation Audio Works



Most hypnosis, whether face-to-face or delivered through audio/video, generally follows these steps:

- **Introduction:** Aims to relax the subject and alleviate any tension. This usually involves deep breathing.
- **Induction:** Guides the subject to relax further and gradually slows down their brain waves, transitioning from β-waves to α-waves.
- **Testing (optional):** Tests whether the subject has entered the α-wave state. This is almost exclusively done in face-to-face sessions; audio and video rarely include this step.
- **Narration:** The process of subconscious suggestion begins, telling the subject's subconscious what to do and think.
- **Stabilization (optional):** Stabilizes the hypnotic state to prevent the subject from waking up and helps them get used to the feeling of being hypnotized.
- **Awakening:** Wakes the subject. The hypnotist can choose whether to make the subject forget the session. It's also usually fine to not wake them up, as they will typically wake up naturally after sleeping, but to prevent potential issues, most hypnosis includes this part.

Hypnotic masturbation audio basically follows this traditional hypnosis process, which is why the "hypnosis" part of hypnotic masturbation audio can be so effective.

The "masturbation" part is usually placed within the narration. In a stable α-wave state, the subconscious can easily affect the body's functions and make simple adjustments to sensations and feelings, such as feeling heat, cold, sadness, excitement, pain, numbness, soothing, relaxation, and euphoria. Hypnotic masturbation takes advantage of this by continuously relaxing and stacking feelings of excitement and euphoria to achieve its goal.

However, due to individual physical constitutions and the nature of audio as a medium, hypnotic audio/video works cannot perform the testing and stabilization steps. This directly affects the subject's receptivity and the depth and stability of their hypnotic state. This is why most hypnotic audio requires the subject to listen multiple times to achieve the desired effect (although most hypnotists rarely perform these two steps now).

In the α-wave state, it is not possible to influence more detailed sensations, such as distinct tastes (sour, sweet, bitter, spicy), or specific tactile sensations (e.g., making someone feel they are touching a jade burial suit). It also cannot make someone imagine things they have never seen, perform actions that violate their physical abilities, or go against their personal values.

In the α-wave state, all sensations and feelings are a result of the subject's brain processing, so there are many limitations. In face-to-face hypnosis, the hypnotist adjusts the content and method of their script, but in hypnotic audio, the listener needs to do the imagining and adjusting themselves.
