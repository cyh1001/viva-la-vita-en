# Viva La Vida Knowledge Base

The Viva La Vida Knowledge Base is a knowledge sharing project initiated by Viva La Vida creators who love communication and sharing, dedicated to producing, collecting, and disseminating knowledge about sexual development. Some of our content comes from translations of foreign internet content, and some comes from practical experience summaries from the Viva La Vida community. We hope this knowledge can be helpful to you.
