# Nipple: Introduction

### Introduction



This document will help you understand the basic principles, practical methods, and key considerations for **nipple development**.

### What is "乳首" (rǔ shǒu)?



"乳首" (rǔ shǒu) is a Japanese loanword, and its corresponding native Chinese term is "乳头" (rǔ tóu). However, in the Chinese online communities, discussions about the sexual development of nipples were initially introduced from Japanese internet culture. Because the Japanese Kanji for "head" is 首 (shǒu), the same character used for "head" in ancient Chinese, the term "乳首" is still used in the "生如夏花" community and in this document out of custom.

### Why Develop the Nipples?



Before we officially begin development, let's address why you should choose the nipples as an erogenous zone. Understanding the characteristics of the nipples and the sensations they can provide will greatly increase your motivation.

The nipples have the following advantages:

- **Easy to Develop:** Take prostate development as an example. A single prostate masturbation session requires time for an enema, activating anal pleasure, and cleaning tools. The time for preparation and actual development can easily exceed an hour. In addition, prostate development requires tools like butt plugs. In contrast, nipple development only requires your fingers to achieve a **dry orgasm**, with almost no special preparation or cleanup. It doesn't take much time, so even busy people can easily practice it. Because you can try masturbating multiple times, the nipples are arguably the fastest area to achieve a dry orgasm.

- **Synergizes with Other Erogenous Zones:** The nipples have great compatibility with other erogenous zones. When combined with the prostate, perineum, and penis, they can amplify pleasure. (Author's note: I do not personally recommend connecting with prostate pleasure.) This means that regardless of what other development you pursue later—such as hypnosis or prostate development—starting with the nipples is never a loss. Regardless of your effort level, regular development is highly recommended.

- **Has an Automated Development Method:** As will be explained in detail later, you can use **magnetic patches** to automatically develop the nipples to a certain extent. While you can't rely on magnetic patches alone, they are an excellent tool compared to other development methods like hypnosis (which can be time-consuming to get started with).

- **Stronger Orgasm Pleasure:** As experienced nipple dry orgasm practitioners know, there are many types of nipple dry orgasms. To help beginners better understand, here is a rough list of some of the types of dry orgasms:

  - A climax with a heavenly sense of **bliss and satisfaction**.
  - A stimulating climax that makes you gasp and struggle, making your consciousness feel strange.
  - A wonderful climax where your entire body feels **tingly and numb**.
  - A climax with a shocking impact, like a **bolt of lightning**.
  - A gentle, sweet, and happy climax, like a peaceful mountain climb.
  - A climax where nipple pleasure spreads throughout the body, making it a full-body erogenous zone with pleasure coming in **waves**.
  - A climax where the inside of your buttocks feels hot and numb, and your lower back melts with pleasure.
  - An enhanced version of a normal ejaculation, with a pleasure that lasts dozens of times longer.
  - A climax where feelings of love overflow, making you feel both sad and comfortable.

  Even this rough list shows that there are many types of pleasure, and you can distinguish important sensations based on how you touch the nipples and how you build up your mood. The nipples are an erogenous zone that is both easy to develop and offers such a rich variety of pleasure. In fact, you can expect the nipples to be the next major source of a dry orgasm.

- **Filled with Feelings of Bliss and Orgasm that Are Not Experienced in Daily Life:** As mentioned earlier, a dry orgasm from the nipples can make you **cry from an overwhelming sense of happiness** and provide a sense of complete fulfillment. This is a feeling of bliss that is more intense than any you experience in daily life. The impact of such a powerful subjective feeling is something you can't get otherwise. Without a doubt, this is a pleasure that everyone should experience at least once.
