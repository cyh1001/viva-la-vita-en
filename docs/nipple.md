# Nipple: Introduction

This document will help you understand the basic principles, practical methods, and precautions of nipple development.

## What is Nipple?

Nipple (乳首) is a Japanese loanword. The corresponding Chinese native vocabulary is actually nipple (乳头). However, because discussions about nipple sexual development in the Chinese internet world were initially introduced from the Japanese internet world, and in Japanese the character corresponding to "头" (head) is "首" (corresponding to ancient Chinese usage habits), therefore out of habit, in the "Viva La Vida" community and in this document we still use the term "nipple" (乳首).

## Why Develop Nipples?

Before formally starting development, let's first answer the question of why to choose nipples as an erogenous zone. Understanding the characteristics of nipples and knowing what kind of feelings can be obtained through nipples as a foundation for development can greatly enhance motivation.

Nipples have the following advantages:

**Simple development.** Taking prostate development as an example, one prostate masturbation session requires time for enemas, anal pleasure activation, and cleaning tools. This time plus the time actually used for development can easily exceed 1 hour. Additionally, prostate development also requires tools like anal plugs. In comparison, nipple development only requires fingers to achieve dry orgasm, requires almost no special preparation and post-processing, and doesn't take much time. **Busy people can also simply carry out development**. Because you can try masturbation multiple times, nipples can be said to be **the fastest part to achieve dry orgasm**.

**Can achieve multiple orgasms.** Nipple orgasms are different from penis ejaculation orgasms and don't have a refractory period, so multiple consecutive orgasms are possible. This gives nipple masturbation a huge advantage.

**Low physical burden.** Unlike prostate development which requires enemas and cleaning, or penis endurance training which requires long periods of edging, nipple development has almost no physical burden on the practitioner.

**High degree of freedom.** You can do nipple development almost anywhere, anytime. Whether at home, in a hotel, or even in places like cars or fitting rooms, as long as you can ensure you won't be disturbed, you can practice nipple development.

**Easy to hide.** Nipple development doesn't require removing lower body clothing, so if someone suddenly comes over, you can quickly return to a normal state without being noticed.

These advantages make nipple development very suitable as an introductory practice for sexual development, especially for beginners who want to experience dry orgasms.
