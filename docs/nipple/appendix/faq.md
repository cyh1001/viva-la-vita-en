# Nipple FAQ

### FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)



------

1. How can I buy magnetic patches in China?

   You can search on Taobao for keywords like "祐徳" (note: it's 徳, not 德), "磁石针" (magnetic needle), or "磁针贴" (magnetic patch).

2. Does using magnetic patches hurt?

   No, it shouldn't. The needle and the magnet in a magnetic patch are separate. The magnet has a hole in the middle, and when you apply the patch normally, the needle is pushed out. So, it won't hurt unless you intentionally press on it. For example, a Yuu-toku brand patch has a needle length of 2.0 mm and a magnet thickness of 0.9 mm, so the needle only protrudes by 1.1 mm.

3. Are magnetic patches waterproof, and can I shower with them on?

   The waterproofing on the Yuu-toku brand is a bit weak, but it's fine for showering. In hot weather, the waterproofing may be affected. If you're worried about waterproofing, you can apply another layer of "医用pu膜" (medical PU film) on top.

4. What if I have inverted nipples? Can I still develop them?

   There are two methods for inverted nipples:

   - Buy a "**乳头凹陷矫正器**" (nipple inversion corrector) first to correct the nipples, then start development. Based on practice, these correctors are somewhat effective.
   - Buy a "**掀针**" (lift needle) directly for development. Since it has no magnet, the needle is longer, so it can stimulate an inverted nipple and help with development.

5. What if I'm a girl, or my nipples are too big?

   If your nipples are too big for the magnetic patch to stick, you can reinforce it with a layer of "透气无纺布空白贴" (blank non-woven breathable patch) or "医用PU膜" (medical PU film).

6. Will nipple development cause my areolas to darken?

   Proper development will not cause your areolas to darken. It's important to avoid friction-based techniques during nipple masturbation.

7. Will developing the nipples and the prostate at the same time interfere with each other?

   No, on the contrary, they will promote each other.

8. Can magnetic patches really not be reused?

   If you're worried about bacterial infections, then don't reuse them. However, if you're only using them on yourself, the risk of infection should be low. You can buy "圆形创可贴 无棉芯" (round Band-Aids without cotton pads) as replacement bandages. After you've used the patch, you can remove the needle and magnet, clean and disinfect them with alcohol spray, and then stick them on the new bandage. The author has done this without any issues.

9. Are there cheaper methods?

   Yes. You can buy "掀针" (lift needles) with a size of 0.22×2.0mm and "圆形创可贴 无棉芯" (round Band-Aids without cotton pads), along with some alcohol spray for disinfection. This allows you to significantly reduce costs by reusing the needles and magnets. However, since the round Band-Aids are less waterproof than the original patches, it's recommended to apply a layer of "医用pu膜" (medical PU film) for waterproofing.

10. Does nipple development really cause my breasts to get bigger?

    According to the author's experience and discussions within the community, continuous development does cause breasts to get bigger, but not by a lot.

11. How can I buy the U.F.O. mentioned in the guide in China?

    You can purchase it through Amazon Japan via cross-border e-commerce. A cheaper alternative is the Wildone brand, which has two products: the Wildone Nipple Cup and the Wildone Nipple Dome. The Nipple Cup is more recommended for its ease of use. For replacement brushes, accessory No. 3 is recommended.

    - **Tip:** You can find cheaper prices on Alibaba than on Taobao, but most stores have a minimum order quantity. However, you can choose "one-piece dropshipping," where you only pay for the extra shipping. Be aware that after-sales service can be more difficult when purchasing from 1688.
