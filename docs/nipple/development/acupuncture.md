# Acupuncture Point Stimulation for Nipple Development

### Magnetic Patch Development



In the previous section, we discussed manual development, but its efficiency is low. For a man whose nipples are currently completely insensitive, it could take 2 to 3 years to develop them, which is clearly not efficient. Therefore, we recommend a tool that can "continuously stimulate the nipples": the **magnetic patch**.

### Magnetic Patch Overview



A magnetic patch is a medical and health product consisting of a short needle, a magnet, and an adhesive bandage. It is used to relieve shoulder pain and improve blood circulation. But one day, it was suddenly discovered to be perfect for nipple development, and its purpose took a turn...

This is because if you apply it to your nipples, they are "continuously being developed" by the stimulation of the magnet and the needle. Considering that the effect of development is directly proportional to the duration of stimulation, these magnetic patches are clearly perfect for nipple development.

Magnetic patches can be purchased on Taobao for 105 yuan per box. Each box contains 30 patches, which can last for about two months.

### Process



1. Keep the magnetic patches on your nipples for several days.
2. Several times a day, provide extra stimulation to your nipples by gently pressing down on the patch or lightly scratching it with your fingernails through your clothes.
3. After a few days, remove the patches. After resting for 1 to 4 days to allow your nipple sensitivity to recover, perform nipple masturbation.
4. After the nipple masturbation session, reapply the magnetic patches to your nipples.

### How to Use Magnetic Patches



After removing the patch from the plastic foam board, place it on the very center of your nipple and gently press it in. If the position is correct, you shouldn't feel any pain, as the needle is very short and won't reach your pain-sensing nerves. Then, cover the areola with the adhesive bandage, "sealing" the nipple.

### Usage Cycle



It's generally recommended to change the patches every 3 days, but this can vary slightly depending on the season. For example, you can keep them on longer in the winter, for about 4 to 7 days. In the summer, however, you'll need to change them every 1 to 2 days if you sweat.

### The Sensation of Removing the Patch



The moment you remove a patch, your nipples may feel a little sensitive, but the sensation will become dull afterward. Therefore, it's not recommended to do nipple masturbation on the day you remove the patches.

When you do masturbate, choose a day when your nipples are as sensitive as possible (or a day when you are as aroused as possible). Because the connection between the nipples and the nerves in your brain will only strengthen after your brain clearly recognizes the pleasure, it's most effective to masturbate when your nipples are highly sensitive or when you're in a highly aroused state.

### The Sensation of Wearing the Patch



During the day, your sympathetic nervous system is dominant, blocking pleasure, so you'll hardly notice the patches. This means you can go about your day as usual.

However, at night, when your parasympathetic nervous system is dominant, you might feel a slight sensation in your nipples, but it should be within an acceptable range.

The longer you wear the patches, the less your nipples will react to them. It seems your body won't react as much to this extra sensation. Although your sensitivity to the patches may decrease, the development of your nipples is still ongoing.

### Precautions



- **Disinfect Before Use:** You should clean your nipples to remove any sweat or dirt before applying the patches. Using a disinfectant would be even better.
- **Discard After Use:** Magnetic patches are disposable. As a rule, once you remove a patch, you should discard it and not reuse it.
- **Potential for Side Effects:** If you have a metal allergy or other reasons for concern, please use the patches with caution.
- **Water Resistance:** If the patches are waterproof, you can keep them on when you shower. If not, it's recommended to remove them a few hours before showering, as the needle might have created a small wound. The patches recommended above are waterproof, but if you choose a different brand, please check their water resistance. However, even if they are waterproof, it's not a good idea to wear them in a public bath or a swimming pool, as some of the additives in the water may have a negative effect.
- **Do Not Remove the Magnet:** If you remove the magnet, the needle will penetrate the nipple more deeply, but this will not make development more efficient and is not safe. Also, you should never press hard on the patches after applying them. This could cause the needle to go in deeper than intended and cause bleeding.
- **Remove If Uncomfortable:** While your nipples may feel a bit unusual, if you feel any pain or strange sensations, it's best to remove them. If you feel itchy, remove the patches immediately and wait for the itching to subside.

### Summary



If you follow these instructions carefully, your pleasure will definitely increase. Your sensitivity will rise one level at a time, with each cycle lasting about 10 to 40 days. You can check your progress by seeing how well you respond to nipple masturbation. If you neglect your nipples for a few weeks, their sensitivity will gradually decrease.
