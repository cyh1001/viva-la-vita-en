### Overview



We usually recommend using magnetic patches for nipple development, but if you want to experience the results of nipple development a little sooner, you may consider the **overspeed recovery** method.

Theoretically, by continuously stimulating nerves, the number of nerves in that area will gradually increase. If that area is an erogenous zone, its sensitivity will also rise. However, there is a way to increase the number of nerves even faster: by causing damage to the nerves.

The human nervous system (within its ability to repair itself) has a tendency to quickly repair an area that has been damaged. When the repair is complete, more cells or nerves will gather in that area than before.

...However, if the injury is too deep, it will cause cell necrosis. If you use that much intensity, the sensitivity of your nipples will decrease in the future. So, the so-called high-speed nipple development method is to "make your nipples hurt" to a "degree where you won't overdo it."

### Method



Basically, you pinch your nipples with your fingers with a force that causes slight pain. Or you can use a regular clothespin to clamp your nipples.

It will hurt a little. (Do masochistic people find this pleasurable? I'm probably a masochist, but I don't.)

Afterward, while it's still hurting, to further damage the inside of the nipple, you twist it up and down with your fingers.

You keep twisting it. It hurts a lot! You might even shed a tear! And due to the oversensitive reaction of the nerves, you might suddenly and uncontrollably arch your body backward.

Don't mind the pain! Imagine that the pain is a form of pleasure. Fantasize about being in your most arousing scenario, being subjected to lewd acts, and having your nipples played with.

This is the only way for the nipples to connect with the pleasure nerves in your brain, allowing for faster development.

Also, don't forget to give your nipples a proper rest after you've abused them. Cells need time to recover. (I'm not sure about the exact amount of rest, but for muscles, it's about 48 hours... I think it changes depending on the extent of the damage.)

If you start to feel your sensitivity decrease along the way, you should stop the intense nipple stimulation and wait for it to recover. When the sensitivity returns, it's a good time to stimulate again. The specific timing varies from person to person, and I don't know what it is for you.

Obviously, if your sensitivity recovers (or even over-recovers), then this development method is suitable for you.

### Precautions



**Summary**

While this is a somewhat forced development method, it can make your sensitivity increase more quickly.

However, the feeling of pleasure will not increase by much. Ultimately, only the sensitivity increases. (Imagine a wound that's about to heal; it feels very sensitive and slightly painful when you press it, but it doesn't make you aroused.)

That being said, as your sensitivity increases, you'll find it easier to get above-average pleasure when you do regular nipple masturbation or development.

So, I think it's perfectly fine to return to the regular development process after you finish high-speed development.
