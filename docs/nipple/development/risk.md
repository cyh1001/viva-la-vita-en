# Risks of Nipple Development

### Risks



Before you begin, we must point out that nipple development is accompanied by the production of estrogen. Therefore, in addition to gaining a new sexual experience, your body will also undergo some other changes.

::: danger Nipple development is irreversible! Because you may experience some undesirable issues, please consider the following points before you begin. :::

::: tip All "years of development" mentioned below refer to continuous sexual development without interruption. In other words, interruptions may weaken these effects, but they will also reduce nipple sensitivity. :::



#### Enlarged Breasts



Nipple development will cause your breasts to grow and your chest skin to become softer. The enlarged breasts won't look like female breasts but more like the pecs of a sumo wrestler. However, they won't grow that quickly. With normal development, they will grow from completely flat to an AA cup in about three years.

If your breasts become too large, you may find them inconvenient. This includes but is not limited to:

- An abnormal appearance.
- Your chest shaking noticeably when you run.
- Your nipples becoming noticeably erect in the cold or when they get wet.



#### Overly Sensitive Breasts



If development makes your breasts too sensitive, the friction from your everyday clothes on your nipples may feel too pleasurable. As a result, you may need to wear a bra during exercise.



#### Feminized Appearance



Your skin may become smoother. To put it bluntly, you may look less masculine.

It could be described as slightly... androgynous. This word doesn't have a bad meaning, but it refers to a face that combines both male and female features and may not be very appealing to look at.

::: tip For those who enjoy cross-dressing, this can be a great way to help. :::



#### Feminized Mindset



Your way of thinking may become more feminine. For example, you may find flowers beautiful, care more about fashion trends, and like cute things. In addition, you will gradually fall in love with "passive reception." (This doesn't mean the "active giving" attribute will disappear; instead, it's an "added" "receiving" attribute.)



#### Dependency on Nipple Stimulation



If you enjoy too much pleasure from nipple masturbation, it will be difficult to go back. A mysterious force will awaken the urge to engage in nipple masturbation... you'll want to do it every few days. Of course, your sexual desire for the nipples will decrease after a session of nipple masturbation or normal masturbation.



#### Uncontrollable Pleasure from Nipple Friction



If your nipples are fully developed, they can trigger sexual pleasure when rubbed intensely (even if that was not the original intention). Therefore, both your body and mind will involuntarily submit to "nipple torment."



#### Negative Emotions



If you haven't fully developed the eroticism of your nipples, you may feel negative emotions when you stimulate them (nipple sad syndrome).

In this case, you can stop stimulating your nipples and gradually eliminate this feeling by taking things one step at a time.

If you are confident that the above issues will not significantly lower your quality of life, then let's begin.
