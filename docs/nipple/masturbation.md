# Nipple Masturbation

### Masturbation



As the saying goes, it takes hard work to grow a cherry tree, but the fruits are delicious. If nipple development is the process of diligent cultivation, then nipple masturbation is the time to enjoy the fruits of our labor. This chapter will first introduce how to get your body into the best possible state before masturbation (to maximize the chances of experiencing intense pleasure and orgasm), and then present various nipple masturbation methods, from beginner to advanced.

For newcomers, it's most important to get familiar with the feeling of your nipples and to forge a connection between nipple touch and pleasure in your brain; the intensity of the pleasure is less important. Therefore, we recommend starting with manual masturbation. Conversely, once you reach a certain level of nipple development, it becomes difficult to control your hands during an orgasm. At that point, using certain toys can help you achieve a longer, more profound climax.

This chapter also describes the sensations of nipple pleasure and orgasm. While these sensations can vary from person to person, we believe it's beneficial for you to have a basic understanding of them before you begin development. This will help you identify what stage you're at during nipple masturbation, build anticipation for the results of your development, and increase your chances of success.
