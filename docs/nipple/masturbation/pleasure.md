# Nipple Masturbation Pleasure

### Climax



------



### Mild Climax



This phenomenon occurs in the initial stages of pleasure accumulation. In this state, your body is temporarily unable to move. The compulsion to stay still is weak, but you simply don't want to move. The unique pleasure of a climax is weak, and the feeling from the erogenous zone is slightly blocked. Your state of consciousness is normal.

It is so mild that you may not even know if it has happened. However, if another person were to observe you, they could probably tell you're climaxing from the strange look on your face and your body's sudden cessation of movement. If you're thinking, "Is this a climax?" or "Is this pleasure or a climax?" you've likely reached this state or are on the verge of it.

While it is technically a climax, it's not the "pleasurable climax" we're seeking. It's more accurately described as a state of concentrated pleasure and a good feeling. It takes about 3 to 20 minutes of masturbation to reach this state. If you continue stimulating for another 3 to 7 minutes, you will reach a normal climax. If your erogenous zone is undeveloped, you will stop here. If your sensitivity is high enough, you will pass through this stage quickly and go straight to a normal climax.

### Normal Climax



This occurs when you continue to stimulate the erogenous zone after a mild climax. The comfort level is moderate, but your body (primarily your lower abdomen) feels a refreshing sensation, and you can clearly tell that a climax is happening. You will instinctively know it is a climax.

At this level of pleasure, some parts of your brain's functions are suspended. You can't see what you're looking at, but you can hear what you're listening to. It's a feeling of temporarily losing your senses. It can also be described as being immersed in darkness. Your vision isn't a complete whiteout but a blank state, similar to the trance-like state after 30 minutes of meditation.

At this level, your sense of self still exists, and you can still think. However, you are unable to move unless you make a great effort because you subjectively don't want to. This pleasure lasts for 1 to 3 minutes. If your eroticism is strong, you will experience a deep climax after a normal climax.

For a developer aiming for climax, this is a milestone. However, an even more pleasurable climax awaits. Let's treat this as a waypoint and continue with special training until we can achieve a deep climax! If your erogenous zones are only developed to a normal level or you don't have a strong desire for pleasure, you will stop here.

### Deep Climax



This is the ideal state, a world full of deep pleasure and bliss. This climax appears after you've had 1 to 3 normal climaxes. Most of your ability to think is lost, and you feel extremely comfortable. You may let out gasps, shed tears, and your body will feel soft, as if it has been struck by lightning.

At this point, it's nearly impossible to consciously move your body. Guided by pleasure, it's hard to express yourself. Also, since the pleasure from the erogenous zone is completely blocked, you will 100% understand that you have reached a climax during a deep climax, unless you have passed out. Even if you can no longer think, you can still grasp certain tangible sensations in your body and understand them subconsciously.

When pursuing a climax, let's make the "deep climax" our goal! It is different from previous climaxes and offers an unparalleled level of pleasure.

### Extremely Deep Climax



This phenomenon occurs when you are in a very aroused state and your erogenous zones are deeply developed. Generally, this is very difficult to achieve. The session usually stops at a "deep climax," but if certain favorable factors exist, your body will go even deeper, and this state will appear.

For example, on a day with high eroticism, in a state of love, during pleasurable domination, after an erotic massage, or as part of a sex session in a specific sequence, it is possible to achieve this. This is an exceptional, bonus reward. This phenomenon can happen to men, but it may not be as easy as it is for women and requires very thorough sexual development.

A massive amount of pleasure floods your brain and body. This is such an intense pleasure that you will subconsciously move your body and let out gasps. Additionally, one or more of the following will occur:

- You cannot escape the pleasure.
- You feel a surging pleasure in your brain and back.
- Your pupils dilate.
- You completely lose your self-awareness and face everything in a subconscious state.
- Objects around you sparkle.
- Your ability to understand disappears, and your sight and hearing stop.
- Images from your memory appear in your vision.
- Your entire body spasms, and you can't stop.
- You feel you are not in the current world but in another one (e.g., in a field of flowers, in a warm ocean, etc.).
- You feel you have gained everything in the world.
- You temporarily lose consciousness.
- You fall asleep.
- The pleasure is unbearable, and you let out gasps while shaking your head.
- For women, incontinence (ejaculation) may occur.
- You have strange bodily sensations (e.g., your lower back floating in a void).
- Your abdomen vibrates at an extremely high speed.
- Your hips move freely.
- You forget the existence of your physical body.
- The pleasure in your body is not interrupted by anything, unlike a deep climax.

If we were to quantify the pleasure:

- Mild climax: 1
- Normal climax: 10
- Deep climax: 100
- Extremely deep climax: 1000

This means an extremely deep climax is so intense that it's 100 times more pleasurable than a normal climax. Such a climax will be accompanied by things like "crying," "letting out loud gasps," "your entire body vibrating in tiny cycles," and "your lower back tensing."

...Yes. Everything I just mentioned came on completely against my will. For women, in addition to the above, there may be uncontrollable female ejaculation. I think you can understand how intense this pleasure is.

You won't be able to return to your normal state for 3 to 10 minutes after a climax. This may be because the sensation is just too pleasurable. If you want to experience the most intense pleasure in a natural state, keep working hard on your sexual development until you reach this state.

### Multiple Orgasms



This phenomenon occurs after you've had 3 to 10 or more continuous orgasms. This may sound terrifying, but it's not. For those who can already have a dry orgasm, this is not too difficult. An "extremely deep climax" is much harder to achieve.

There are two main types of multiple orgasms:

- **Pleasure-based:** A pleasure-based orgasm is a phenomenon where you have several mild orgasms in a row in a comfortable state. This usually happens when a lot of pleasure has accumulated in your body.
- **Spasmodic:** A spasmodic orgasm is a situation where you are forced to climax when your body is under extreme stimulation. For those adult videos with multiple orgasms, if the actress is smiling and happy, it's a "pleasure-based" orgasm. Otherwise, it's probably a "spasmodic" one.

A "pleasure-based" orgasm is relatively better because it's enjoyable, while a "spasmodic" one is more ambiguous, as it tends to happen when the pleasure has already disappeared. You climax, but you waste your body's energy for little pleasure. Specifically, when you have over 20 continuous orgasms, you may experience problems like hyperventilation, and your lower back muscles will be sore the next day. Because such things can happen, when you can no longer feel the pleasure of a climax, you should just go to sleep.

### Questions



Is it really okay to have nipple orgasms?

If you go to sleep immediately after a climax, you will be back to normal the next day. Even if you don't, the pleasure will be reset and you will return to normal after about 1 to 6 hours.

Is it okay to have frequent orgasms?

It's generally okay to masturbate every two to three days and have about five orgasms. The orgasms you can trigger frequently are natural ones, so it's okay as long as you're not doing it too often.
