# Nipple Masturbation Preparation

### Preparation



It is crucial to meet the following conditions to ensure a good experience. If these conditions are not met, the pleasure from nipple masturbation will be significantly reduced, and you will be wasting valuable "nipple energy." It's best to choose another day.

### Necessary Conditions



- **Rest:** Avoid stimulating your nipples for one to three days to allow their "sexual energy" to recover.
- **Abstinence:** Avoid normal masturbation for one to three days.
- **Good Mood:** Avoid days when you're not in the mood for sex. It's best not to do sexual activities when you don't feel like it, as your eroticism may be very low.
- **No Distractions:** Avoid any factors that may interfere with your session, such as being too hot or too cold, insects, fatigue, illness, or other people at home.
- **Start at the Right Time:** Although it's fine to do it at night, avoid doing it too late, as sleepiness can reduce pleasure by as much as 50%.
- **Enough Time:** A relaxed state of mind is very important for sex. It's best to avoid it when you're feeling stressed.

### Optional Conditions



These conditions are not essential, but they will make the experience much more pleasurable.

- **Something to Hold:** It feels very blissful to hold a pillow at the end of the session.
- **Nighttime:** You can do it during the day, but it's more effective at night.
- **Deep Breathing:** Doing several to dozens of rounds of diaphragmatic breathing will make the pleasure more intense.
- **Pee First:** The urge to urinate can block the accumulation of eroticism. Let's take care of our physiological needs first.

### Before You Begin



1. Take a Relaxing Bath. This allows your parasympathetic nervous system to become dominant, which significantly changes your eroticism. After bathing, do not start right away. Wait a little for your body to cool down, as this increases eroticism.

   (Translator's note: The author probably means a "soaking bath," but a "shower" can also work if you don't have a bathtub.)

2. **Brush Your Teeth.** This might seem strange, but a clean body can have a positive effect on eroticism. Also, make sure your hair is dry after bathing.

3. **Watch 10 Minutes of Erotic Content.** After your bath, immerse yourself in an erotic anime, manga, audio, or novel for a while. This will condition your brain and make you more receptive to sexual stimulation.

4. **Prepare Tissues.** Men should wrap their glans, and women should place tissues near their vaginal opening. Nipple masturbation often secretes a lot of fluid, so placing tissues in your underwear will prevent messes.

5. **Prepare a Futon.** It's best to do this 30 minutes to an hour before your normal bedtime.

6. **Dim the Lights.** Bright lights can be distracting and reduce pleasure.

7. Prepare to Touch Your Nipples. You can put your hand inside your clothes to touch your chest.

   It's important not to expose your abdomen. If you do, you may find it difficult to concentrate on the pleasure because your mind will be preoccupied with keeping warm. Alternatively, you can wrap a towel around your abdomen if you're naked.

### Nipple Masturbation Process



I believe this is a good sequence to follow.

1. **Make Your Nipples Erect.** Try touching your nipples with your middle finger. If they become erect, you can proceed to the next step.
2. **Start Nipple Masturbation!** Pinch your nipple from top to bottom and twist it. You can continue this until the pleasure starts to decrease. It's very pleasurable. If you can climax, try to have multiple orgasms here! After a few orgasms, you won't get much more pleasure from the nipples alone, so let's move on to the next step.
3. **Stretch Your Underwear and Gently Stroke through It.** Stretch your underwear over your chest and make sure it's as taut and wrinkle-free as possible. Once ready, use the second masturbation method. Sometimes, this can produce a drunken-like pleasure. This is a distinctly different pleasure from the perineum. This method works best when your brain is filled with eroticism after steps 2 and 3. You can have one to three orgasms. If you can't climax, you can stop when you feel good. If you continue this too much, you will eventually reach a state where "sensation > pleasure," and your lower back will involuntarily tremble. This doesn't sound very good. If you do it too much, you may feel back pain in your daily life. If the stimulation feels much more intense than the pleasure, you won't be able to feel pleasure during a climax, so I believe you should end the session honestly.
4. **Hold a Pillow or Futon.** In some cases, you may have an intense urge to hold something between steps 3 and 5. If you stop and hold it tightly at that point, you will feel very blissful. It's best to fall asleep while holding a pillow at the end of the session.

That's it. This sequence can lead to a very high level of pleasure without any significant complications.
