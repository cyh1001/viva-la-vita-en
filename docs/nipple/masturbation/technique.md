# Techniques

You can choose to use your hands or other toys for nipple masturbation. Here, we will only discuss methods that use your hands.

### Before You Begin: Check Nipple Eroticism



If you don't feel pleasure when you gently touch your nipples, it's a sign that this might not be a good day for nipple masturbation. Continuing with nipple masturbation when your eroticism is weak will needlessly deplete your valuable "nipple sexual energy." So, if you want to have a pleasurable nipple masturbation session, it's best to do it on a day when your sensitivity is high.

### Nipple Masturbation Techniques



- Pinch the nipple from top and bottom, then rotate.
- Scratch through your underwear with your fingernails.
- Pinch the nipple, and vary the pressure.
- Pinch the nipple, and gently pull it outwards.
- Rub the areola.
- Rub and rotate the nipple with your fingertips.
- Gently rub with the pads of your fingers.
- Flick with your fingernails.
- Press the nipple.
- Repeatedly tap the nipple.
- Clamp the areola.
- Vibrate your fingers while they are in contact with the nipple.
- Rub the nipple and the areola with your fingers.

Among these, the most intense pleasure comes from methods 1 and 2. If your nipple eroticism is very developed, methods 3, 4, and 11 can also lead to a nipple orgasm.

Below are detailed explanations for methods 1 and 2.

### Method 1: Pinch the Nipple from Top and Bottom and Rotate



1. **Lie Down:** Lie in a position with your back supported by a futon or a bed. Your nipples' eroticism will be significantly enhanced in these relaxed postures.
2. **Make the Nipple Erect:** If your nipple is not erect, gently stroking the areola will make it erect. However, if you have no nipple sensitivity, this may not work.
3. **Pinch the Erect Nipple with Your Fingers:** Gently pinch the nipple from the top and bottom with your thumb and middle finger. You can use any fingers as long as you can pinch it. If your nipples are too small to get a good erection, you can pinch the areola instead.
4. **Rotate the Nipple:** Rotate for 30 to 90 seconds, moving gently.
5. **Rest if Nipple Eroticism Becomes Dull:** If you continuously stimulate your nipples, their sensitivity will gradually decrease. Also, when your entire body is relaxed, the pleasure will dissipate quickly. If you're having trouble feeling your nipples, you should rest for a while. After 10 to 20 seconds of rest, your nipple sensitivity will return, and you can continue stimulating for 30 to 90 seconds and enjoy it. Additionally, if you stimulate your milk ducts during the rest period (assuming their eroticism is developed), the pleasure from your nipples will be enhanced.
6. **Repeat the Nipple Rotation:** Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you climax! Enjoy the pleasure from your nipples until you are satisfied.
7. **Do not Rest if a Climax is Near:** If you feel a climax is approaching, you can continuously stimulate for more than 3 minutes without resting. Then, you will feel something in your body become soft, and the climax will arrive. A climax is followed by continuous pleasure. You should, in principle, continue stimulating for at least 1 minute after the climax. Since the commands to your fingers are simple, you can continue to move your fingers for masturbation even when the pleasure is very deep.

After you get used to this technique, you will be able to use this (the most basic nipple masturbation method) to reach a climax.

### Method 2: Scratch through Your Underwear with Your Fingernails



1. **Put on Underwear:** If you're wearing a shirt, make sure it's stretched smooth. Wrinkles will reduce the pleasure of scratching. Then, lie down and start nipple masturbation.
2. **Gently Play through Your Underwear:** Raise your middle fingernail, and starting from a position slightly below the nipple, scratch what you're wearing until you pass over the nipple and go up. Initially, you won't feel much, but repeating this action will make your nipples feel good.
3. **Repeat the Action:** Repeat at your own rhythm. I'm not sure if you need to rest here. For those who are trying nipple masturbation for the first time, I feel this technique is more likely to give you a sensation.

### On the Intensity of Stimulation



For both methods, you should avoid giving your nipples too strong of a stimulus. Too strong of a stimulus will reduce your nipple sensitivity. Gentle stimulation is good enough. If it doesn't feel good, it's likely that the pleasure nerves in your nipples haven't been developed enough.

### On the Amount of Nipple Eroticism



Nipples accumulate something akin to sexual energy. This energy builds up in daily life and is consumed during nipple masturbation. It takes time to replenish this energy after it has been consumed. If your nipple eroticism is somewhat developed, about 3 to 4 days after masturbation is enough time to accumulate sufficient eroticism.

### Comparison of Pleasure from Different Methods



The pleasure from Method 1 and Method 2 is quite different, mainly because they stimulate different areas:

- The "pinch and rotate" method stimulates the **inside of the nipple**, where the nipple pleasure nerves are rooted.
- The "scratch with fingernails" method stimulates the **surface of the nipple**, which is the nerve endings of the nipple pleasure nerves.

**Pleasure from Method 1:** It's a sweet, gentle pleasure. The purity of the pleasure is relatively high. If you accumulate this pleasure, you will be submerged in a feeling of climax and feel very comfortable.

**Pleasure from Method 2:** It's a numb pleasure. If you accumulate this pleasure, your lower abdomen and back will have strong spasms, and you will feel a current of pleasure passing through your body.

Which one is easier to climax with? I feel Method 1 is easier.

### Using Both Methods Simultaneously



You can use both methods at the same time to feel even more comfortable, but be mindful of the order:

- **Method 1 → Method 2:** You will enjoy the pleasure of Method 2 while accumulating the pleasure of Method 1.
- **Method 2 → Method 1:** The effect of Method 1 may be reduced if you use it after Method 2.

In short, if you want to enjoy both at the same time, it is recommended to use the sequence of "Method 1 → Method 2." (This may vary from person to person).

That's it. When you have a pleasurable nipple masturbation session, your brain will be stimulated, which will accelerate the development of your nipple eroticism. Therefore, nipple masturbation is just as important as development itself!
