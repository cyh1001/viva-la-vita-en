# Nipple Masturbation Toys

### Toys



------



### Overview



Nipple toys include friction-type, vibration-type (like vibrators), suction-type (like piston vacuum pumps), and tension-type (like nipple clamps). Here, we only recommend **friction-type** toys. The reasons are as follows: vibration-type toys are often used for clitoral stimulation in women, but for nipples, due to their weaker eroticism, they can easily cause numbness. Suction-type and tension-type toys can cause some pain and may enlarge the nipples.

Friction-type toys are typically hemispherical. They can be placed over the nipple and stimulate it with soft brushes. Specifically, there are a few options:

- **Wildone** (¥670)
- **UFO** (approx. ¥470)
- **UFO SA** (approx. ¥1360)

The latter two were recommended in the original Japanese blog, but the Wildone product is more commonly used in the "Born Like a Summer Flower" community, likely due to ease of purchase. Their principles are roughly the same, so the following sections mainly use the original Japanese blog's descriptions of the UFO and UFO SA.

### Introduction and Comparison of UFO and UFO SA



The **"UFO series"** (referring to the UFO and UFO SA) are adult toys specifically designed for nipples. They are by far the best nipple toys, and wearing one on your chest will give you a complete nipple torment experience!

The principle of the UFO series is to stimulate the nipples with a rotating silicone brush structure at the center. Its motion provides a very comfortable friction for the nipples, which can sustain pleasure for up to 20 minutes.

The UFO SA is the successor to the UFO. Despite this, it has its own set of issues. Here's a summary:

| Feature             | UFO SA                                                | UFO                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Design**          | Integrated, making it more convenient to use.         | Modular; can replace components if broken.                   |
| **Durability**      | More durable than UFO.                                | Can be irreversibly damaged after 20-50 uses.                |
| **Charging**        | Rechargeable via USB, very convenient.                | Uses replaceable batteries; can run out after a few months of use. |
| **Customization**   | Customizable stimulation intensity.                   | Can run at a very low speed.                                 |
| **Material**        | The material is relatively hard.                      | The material is relatively soft.                             |
| **Vibration**       | New vibration components provide a better experience. | Vibration components are less advanced.                      |
| **Port**            | The charging port is prone to poor contact.           | No charging port.                                            |
| **Power**           | The lowest power setting is not low enough.           | Can run at a very low speed.                                 |
| **Suction**         | Suction power is stronger.                            | Suction power is weaker.                                     |
| **Weight**          | Heavier.                                              | Lighter.                                                     |
| **Cord**            | Anti-tangling design.                                 | Cord can easily get tangled.                                 |
| **Vibration Modes** | Has more vibration modes and components.              | Has fewer vibration modes and components.                    |

Overall, the UFO SA is slightly better. While a low speed is more important for a pleasurable nipple masturbation session (so the UFO can be more pleasant), the UFO is too fragile, so the UFO SA is more highly recommended.

### Precautions



When using the UFO series toys, you should be aware of the following:

- **Start after a certain level of development.** The UFO series has no effect on undeveloped nipples. You should first develop your nipples before you use a UFO. It's only useful after you've reached level 8.
- **Cleanliness is important.** You should clean the suction cup part after use and disinfect it. After all, it comes into contact with your skin.
- **It is not waterproof.** The mechanical part of the device cannot get wet, so be careful when cleaning parts other than the suction cup.
- For the UFO SA, the connection can easily come loose if it's not tight. Therefore, it's best to use it while lying on your back.
- The UFO has an effective lifespan of several months, so it can be considered a consumable item. However, it can be repaired by disassembling it, so it's possible to identify and replace the broken component.

### Comparison of the UFO Series with Manual Stimulation



For developed nipples, it's perfect! Considering all performance indicators, it's the best. The specific reasons include: it's a non-vibration device, it doesn't require manual operation, and it can stimulate the nipples without subjective intention. These are important elements for nipple masturbation, so it strongly enhances pleasure.

The stimulation comes from a soft brush, and the nipples and areola receive a gentle stimulus. It's a very unique pleasure that's different from the pleasure of licking. The entire nipple will continuously feel a warm, numb sensation.

However, if your sexual development is not sufficient, it will be more difficult to climax with a UFO than with your hands. This is because nipples climax more easily from "internal stimulation," such as the first technique of nipple masturbation, while the UFO can only provide "external stimulation." With repeated use, the nipples will slowly get used to this stimulation, so it's not a big problem.

For nipple masturbation enthusiasts who can afford it, place an order! Some unique pleasures can only be experienced with a UFO.

### Preparation



- **Lubricant:** You must use lubricant with a UFO to prevent the brush from causing friction burns on your skin.
- **Wipes:** You should wipe the lubricant off your hands promptly during the session. You should also clean up afterward.
- **Something to Secure the UFO:** If you just place it on your chest without any other support, it can easily fall off. Using lubricant will help it stick to your chest. You can also use a sports bra or other supportive items to keep it in place.
- **Install the brush components:** I think this is one of the most interesting parts. The performance of different components is different for each person, so you have to try them yourself!

### How to Use



Place it on your chest, turn on the switch, and it's that simple!

- **Find Your Erogenous Spot:** Start with the lowest power setting and move it bit by bit until you find the best position for stimulation and pleasure. The first position you try is rarely the best erogenous spot. You should adjust it!
- **Take a Proper Break:** If you continuously stimulate your nipples for too long, their sensitivity may decrease. After every 3 minutes of use, it's best to stop and wait for 10 seconds to allow your nipple sensitivity to recover.
- **Haste Makes Waste:** Increasing the power will not increase pleasure. Although the stimulation is strong, the eroticism inside the nipples may not be awakened. Generally, a continuous stimulation of 1 to 2 gears is sufficient. Too strong a stimulation will prevent a dry orgasm.
- **Putting Your Hands Behind Your Head Enhances Pleasure:** I'm not sure why, but this position seems to have a miraculous effect.
- **Pillows:** You can place a pillow or something with a nice texture nearby. This will provide an added pleasure boost.

### Methods to Enhance UFO Usage Comfort



I believe these 10 actions can effectively enhance pleasure.

1. **Strengthen nipple eroticism.** This has been repeated 10,000 times already.

2. **Enhance body eroticism before using a UFO.** This has also been repeated 10,000 times. You can refer to **The Ideal Nipple Masturbation Process**.

3. Make your brain recognize the UFO's stimulation as intense pleasure. After using a UFO many times, your brain will form the impression that "this is a good thing that brings pleasure," and the pleasure you get may gradually increase. Also, if you maintain an aroused mindset during nipple masturbation, the UFO's effect will increase.

   There are two main points: "arousal boosting" and "erotic connection."

   - **Arousal Boosting:** During UFO use, watch videos of women receiving nipple torment or a video of someone using a UFO to masturbate. You can also read erotic novels.

   - Erotic Connection: Stimulate other areas at the same time. For men, this can be the perineum and prostate. For women, it can be clitoral masturbation or penetrative sex. This will make your body believe that "the UFO is a pleasurable experience."

     After repeating "arousal boosting" and "erotic connection" for 1 to 3 months every 3 to 7 days, you can reach a state where you only need a UFO to feel very pleased.

4. Sensualize during nipple masturbation. When using a UFO, imagine yourself as a lustful girl being forced into nipple torment. This will deepen your eroticism. Also, when you feel comfortable, smiling, making cute gestures, and imitating a girl's actions will further deepen the pleasure.

   Also, try to continuously focus your consciousness on the inside of both nipples. If you don't know how to guide your consciousness, try to feel how the inside of the nipples is kneaded and deformed.

5. **Place things that make your skin feel comfortable.** When using a UFO, it's recommended to be naked or half-naked. This allows your skin to come into contact with comfortable things like towels. The pleasure can be further enhanced by this comfortable friction. Repeating friction over a large area can create a gentle but intense pleasure. You can use:

   - A good quality pillow.

   - A towel on the side of the pillow that you can hold with your hand.

   - A towel or bath towel on your back.

   - A towel or cushion on your waist (to create a slight compression effect).

   - A towel to lightly press on the inside of your knees.

   - A towel or futon to cover your body.

     These can all enhance the UFO's pleasure. You can also place your arms behind your head to make the pleasure even stronger.

6. Minimize the need for body movement. Once you start a UFO session, you should not move too much, except to change the settings. Excessive movement reduces eroticism, so it's necessary to create an environment where you can focus on pleasure. For example, dim the lights, weaken your phone screen, and set your phone to silent.

   If you wear glasses, you can take them off. Any other items on your body can also affect your eroticism. If you have a partner, they can take care of all of this.

7. Break through your self-imposed limits. Making sounds is quite important during nipple masturbation. If you feel a gasping sound in your heart, try to let it out. If you feel very comfortable, just "come" again and again.

   In fact, when we actively make sounds about our state, our awareness of that state increases, creating a positive feedback loop in the brain. In other words, if you say "I feel so good" in a comfortable state, it means you "can feel even better." Also, "shouting" is important. In this case, rationality is weakened, and your body's instincts take over. Rationality can suppress pleasure. When you make many lustful sounds, you can cast off the shackles of rationality and immerse yourself in lust. When this happens, pleasure flows through your entire body.

   You also have to let your body "permit" pleasure. Even if the pleasure is so intense that you feel you're going to break, you must accept it instead of worrying about it. This is a feeling of completely surrendering to pleasure, and it's very important.

   Intense pleasure can sometimes bring a sense of fear. If you let fear take over, rationality will return, and you will lose your eroticism. Even if the pleasure is too intense and causes a strong bodily reaction, it will slowly return to normal after a while, so don't worry too much.

   In short, during nipple masturbation, you must avoid unnecessary thoughts, except for sexual fantasies.

8. **Add a proper break.** If your muscles are relaxed or you've been enjoying the pleasure for a while, it's best to pause the UFO. This is because muscles that are tense can store strong pleasure, while relaxed muscles cannot. Instead of continuing to stimulate, it's better to stimulate again after a break. This is also a way to deal with fatigue.

9. **Add a little bit of SM play.** For example, blindfolding yourself. This type of SM accessory is very useful for enhancing sensation. By blocking visual signals, your senses will go deep inside your body, and you will feel pleasure more easily. Other SM accessories can also work, given that the UFO itself is a form of SM accessory that "continuously stimulates the erogenous zone." If you are interested in bondage play or domination (self-domination), you can refer to **Methods for SM Masturbation**.

10. **Increase the stimulation intensity in the middle.** The human body doesn't like monotonous stimulation and gets bored easily. Therefore, if you only use a UFO for stimulation, you can easily get bored after 1 to 3 climaxes. For example, if you are also doing electro-shock play during the UFO stimulation, the pleasure from the UFO will be maintained. In short, a better experience requires you to add or change other adult toys, rather than relying solely on the UFO.

That's it. If you use the methods above, the pleasure from a UFO nipple masturbation session will be greatly enhanced.
