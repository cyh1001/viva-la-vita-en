# Nipple Development Principles

### The Principles of Nipple Development



In this section, we will briefly introduce the structure and function of the nipples and discuss why it's possible for men to develop them.

### Nipple Overview



The nipple is an organ located in the center of the breast, including the central raised part and the surrounding circular area, which has a distinct color from the surrounding skin. In Japanese, "乳头" (nīnyu) refers to the central raised part, while "乳轮" (nīrin) refers to the surrounding circular area. For this reason, we will continue to use these loanwords.

The nipple is a shared erogenous zone for both men and women. While a woman's nipples can be used for breastfeeding, a man's cannot, so it is generally believed that a man's nipples serve no practical purpose. However, in the embryonic stage, the physical structures of men and women are not very different, and male nipples are already present in the early stages of the embryo. It is only after a few weeks of embryonic development that a series of sex hormones appear and play their role, allowing male sexual characteristics to develop. By this time, the nipples have already formed. Therefore, although the nipple can be considered an unnecessary organ for males in the history of human evolution, its physiological structure is not essentially different from that of females; in other words, male and female nipples are homologous.

However, due to the need for lactation, women's breasts are relatively larger. At the same time, to ensure that women do not feel bored or uncomfortable during breastfeeding, a rich network of nerve endings has evolved around the nipples, allowing women to feel pleasure during an infant's suckling. Therefore, during a woman's development, through the continuous production and function of estrogen, the nipples become an important erogenous zone.

Most women can get significant sexual pleasure from nipple stimulation, and some can even achieve orgasm from nipple stimulation alone. Studies have shown that women can get about 80% of the pleasure of clitoral stimulation from nipple stimulation. (A reference is needed here.) In contrast, due to a lack of estrogen, the nipples of an average male do not have a rich network of nerve endings and cannot feel significant pleasure.

### The Possibility of Nipple Development



However, it is still possible for men to turn their nipples into a "sexual organ" through certain methods, as supported by numerous examples in the "生如夏花" (Born Like a Summer Flower) community and other related communities. The reasons for this are twofold:



#### Sensitivity Development



**Sensitivity development** refers to promoting the growth of nerves around the nipples to enhance their tactile sensation, usually with stimulating tools like magnetic patches or needle-lifting devices. The main principle here is to induce a sterile inflammation in the nipples.

Many years ago, people confirmed that itching and sexual pleasure are highly correlated in erogenous zones, likely using the same neural pathway. Therefore, the most important thing is to enhance the sensation of itching near the nipples. And itching itself is highly correlated with inflammatory factors in the human body, such as histamine and serotonin. Another important piece of evidence is that many people believe that the mechanism behind treatments like acupuncture is an inflammatory response itself. Inflammation can promote nerve growth and blood vessel dilation, further increasing nipple sensitivity.

Therefore, the focus of sensitivity development is to safely induce sterile inflammation through minor trauma and stimulation, thereby increasing the sensation of itching. At the same time, you must avoid factors that reduce the sensation of itching, such as daily friction, excessive force, stimulation that might damage nerves, and anti-inflammatory drugs.



#### Sexual Pleasure Development



**Sexual pleasure development** refers to transforming the feelings of itching and comfort from the nipples into sexual pleasure. The main point of pleasure development is to stimulate your nipples in a comfortable and aroused state, making yourself feel good and gradually building a connection between nipple stimulation and sexual arousal. A good analogy is the process of exercising your ring finger or toes, where the nerves there don't grow, but the neurons in your brain that control these areas are activated. The effect of kneading and similar actions should be similar; they don't increase the physical sensitivity of the area but activate the corresponding area of the brain, which is, roughly speaking, an increase in sensitivity and pleasure.

### Development is a Long-Term Practice



The two aspects of development mentioned above require a certain degree of change in the body's physiological structure, so it is certainly not something that can be achieved overnight. Before you begin developing, you must be mentally prepared for this. Do not be overly anxious in your pursuit of pleasure and orgasm, but rather slowly enjoy the changes in your body along the way.
