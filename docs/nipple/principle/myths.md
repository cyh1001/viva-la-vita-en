# Nipple Development Myths

### Common Pitfalls in Nipple Development



There are 7 typical, low-efficiency development methods, or "traps," for nipple development:

- **Intensity Trap**
- **Sensitivity Trap**
- **Variety Trap**
- **Size Trap**
- **Device Trap**
- **Climax Pursuit Trap**
- **Climax Pleasure Trap**

The vast majority of people who cannot achieve a dry orgasm from their nipples have fallen into one or more of these traps. Since these are common mistakes, even those with no prior nipple development experience should read about them.

The knowledge in this chapter will be applied throughout the rest of the document. While you can skip it in extreme cases, understanding the more fundamental aspects of the nipples will greatly help you make the connection to a dry orgasm, so reading it is highly recommended.

#### 1. Intensity Trap: Believing Stronger Stimulation Leads to Climax



- **Wrong:** Strong touches increase pleasure and lead to a climax.
- **Right:** Gentle stimulation provides continuous pleasure and makes a climax easier to achieve.

This is a common misconception for those who know nothing about the nipples. Strong stimulation will temporarily increase the immediate response, but the nipples will quickly get used to it, rendering it ineffective. Unlike the penis, where stronger stimulation often leads to more pleasure, the nipples are very delicate and require a completely different masturbation technique.

**Solutions:**

- **Touch your nipples through a shirt.** This will naturally suppress overly strong stimulation. It's recommended to touch them through a thin shirt. Uniqlo's Air Rhythm shirts are popular among nipple enthusiasts for their pleasant feel, and smooth materials like silk or satin also work well. However, a regular polyester shirt is sufficient, so you don't need to overthink it.
- **Feather-touch.** If this is hard to understand, imagine gently stroking a baby's face. Treat the nipples as a delicate and fragile object, and you should be able to touch them lightly and properly. For the nipples, the same treatment can bring completely different levels of pleasure and duration. Using the feather-touch with a shirt can create a very weak stimulus, which is highly recommended.

#### 2. Sensitivity Trap: Believing Increased Sensitivity Leads to Climax



- **Wrong:** Using magnetic patches to increase sensitivity will eventually lead to a climax.
- **Right:** A minimum level of sensitivity is enough. What's more important is increasing your "eroticism."

Before defining what eroticism is, let's look at why sensitivity alone is not enough to achieve a climax, based on the past mistakes of volunteers.

In nipple development, magnetic patches (such as "Sporban") are often mentioned. These are originally tools used for acupuncture therapy.

Their original purpose is to relieve stiffness, but using the needles to stimulate the nipples can dramatically increase sensitivity in a very short amount of time, so they have become a popular development tool.

However, many developers fall into the sensitivity trap.

High sensitivity itself is not a condition for a climax. Specifically, can you achieve a dry orgasm by stimulating a highly sensitive glans? Of course, the glans, nipples, and prostate can all be pathways to a dry orgasm. So what is the actual condition for a climax?

To answer this, we need to introduce the concept of **"eroticism."**

The Definition of Eroticism

Eroticism is the ability to transform a stimulus into pleasure.

In contrast, sensitivity is the ability to perceive a stimulus. The relationship between them can be described as: Pleasure = Eroticism × Sensitivity × Stimulus. Sensitivity acts as an input, widely capturing stimuli. Eroticism's job is to interpret this input, output it as pleasure, and increase it until it reaches a climax.

From this, it's clear that if your output ability is poor, no amount of stimulation will lead to a climax. This leads to the solution for the sensitivity trap.

**Solution:**

- **Feel and remember the pleasure activation of your nipples and your entire body.** In conclusion, the best way to improve your eroticism is through **"pleasure activation."** Continue to activate pleasure in your nipples until you become restless with desire for more pleasure. After that, perform your usual stimulation, and you will find yourself unconsciously experiencing pleasure that makes your lower back desperately arch.

Why does doing this improve your eroticism, increase pleasure, and make climaxing easier? Because when a person desires something, and that something arrives, the good feeling is greatly amplified. For example, everyone has experienced how a drink of water tastes completely different on a hot day compared to a normal day, even though the water itself is the same. The same logic applies to nipple stimulation. By stimulating your nipples after your body has become restless with desire for pleasure, you can experience pleasure that is many times more intense than usual.

We will explain the specific techniques for pleasure activation in a later chapter. For now, just know that pleasure activation is the key to a climax.

#### 3. Variety Trap: Believing Constant Changes in Stimulation Lead to Climax



- **Wrong:** Experiencing various nipple-touching techniques and changing stimulation to avoid boredom will lead to a climax.
- **Right:** Consistent, gentle stimulation is fundamental. Occasional changes in stimulation will make a climax much easier to achieve.

There are many ways to stimulate the nipples, but only four methods are likely to lead to a climax. Furthermore, trying various methods and constantly changing your stimulation will make it very difficult to reach a climax.

The process of a climax is to gradually accumulate pleasure until it becomes unbearable and overflows. Using the same gentle stimulation makes it easier to feel the accumulation and connection of pleasure, which is better suited for a climax. On the other hand, changing your method every few seconds causes the nature of the pleasure to change, making it difficult to be aware of the accumulation of pleasure.

Even with the same theory and stimulation method, it's better to maintain a consistent level of stimulation that is neither too strong nor too weak. Of course, stimulating your nipples routinely can also lead to boredom and a decrease in pleasure, so it is recommended to rotate a few stimulation methods.

**Solution:**

- **Rotate stimulation methods every few tens of seconds (or until you start to feel a little bored).** This document will detail easy-to-climax nipple masturbation techniques later.

#### 4. Size Trap: Believing Nipple Hypertrophy Leads to Climax



- **Wrong:** Pleasure is roughly proportional to nipple size.
- **Right:** Making nipples larger does not increase the number of pleasure-sensing nerves. In fact, increasing their size might make it harder to feel pleasure.

This is a very common trap, likely due to the name "nipple development" itself, or videos of men with large nipples looking very pleased. However, nipple size itself has no correlation with nipple pleasure. The reason is that suction methods that increase nipple size only stretch the skin; they do not cause the pleasure-sensing nerves to proliferate. They may even reduce the average number of nerves per unit area, so people with smaller nipples might find it easier to feel pleasure.

The relationship between nerve count and pleasure can be seen by considering the difference in pleasure between the penis and the clitoris. These two are biologically homologous, and their nerve count can be considered similar. The penis has a larger area, so it's harder to feel pleasure. The clitoris has a smaller area, but the number of nerves per unit area is overwhelmingly higher than the penis, making it easier to feel pleasure. (Translator's note: The claim that the nerve count is the same is false. The clitoris has about 8,000 neurons, roughly double that of the glans penis. However, the area of the penis is much larger than twice the area of the clitoris, so the author's theory still holds value.)

The same logic applies to nipples. Smaller nipples find it easier to feel pleasure. This is counterintuitive, as one would assume a larger area would lead to more pleasure. However, there is a method to increase the number of nerves: **milk duct development**.

**Solution:**

- **Develop your milk ducts.** The milk ducts are a group of nerves inside the nipple that are connected to the tip. The cloud-like parts in the image are the milk ducts. While men's breasts and milk ducts are not as developed as women's, they can still be developed to achieve pleasure. Developing the milk ducts will turn the entire chest into a pleasure-sensing erogenous zone. From the perspective of increasing the area that feels pleasure, this is far more effective than nipple hypertrophy.

The method for developing the milk ducts is to use clothespins to pinch and stimulate the nerves. Because it's a bit complex, it will be introduced in a later chapter.

#### 5. Device Trap: Believing Using a UFO or Other Devices Will Lead to a Climax



- **Wrong:** Using expensive, automatic nipple stimulation tools like UFOs will help you achieve a climax.
- **Right:** The role of a tool is to enhance existing pleasure, so it's not very useful for beginners.

The "UFO" mentioned here is not an Unknown Flying Object, but an automated nipple stimulation tool. While it can stimulate the nipples, it's not helpful for people in the basic development and climax practice stages. Many beginners misunderstand this. Some even fall into the Variety Trap by using the device's various techniques and intensity settings, constantly changing the stimulation. (Image source: https://www.vorze.jp/ufosa/)

The general consensus among nipple enthusiasts is that the UFO is a tool designed to help those who can already climax experience an even deeper pleasure. There are very few people who learned to climax because they used a UFO.

**Solution:**

- **Use only your fingers to feel and remember how to increase pleasure.** This is absolutely sufficient for beginners. I understand the impatience of wanting to climax as soon as possible, but buying a device will not help you improve your efficiency.

#### 6. Climax Pursuit Trap: Believing Strong Desire for a Climax Leads to It



- **Wrong:** Making climax your primary goal will make it easy to achieve.
- **Right:** Putting the goal of climaxing aside for a while and focusing on the good feelings will paradoxically lead to a climax.

Let's clarify: a climax is an inevitable byproduct of accumulated pleasure. Ignoring this fact and only focusing on climaxing will lead to frustration and a sense of powerlessness because it cannot be learned overnight, and you may even lose motivation. Also, by only focusing on climaxing, you might ignore the process of "getting more pleasure," which will distance you from a climax.

In positive psychology, it is believed that people who excessively pursue happiness become overly aware of the gap between reality and their ideal, making them unhappy. This phenomenon is called the "paradox of the pursuit of happiness," and the same applies to a dry orgasm.

**Solution:**

- **Focus your attention on the pleasure.** Since pleasure is not a boolean value like achieving a goal, your motivation will be more stable. Furthermore, by focusing on pleasure, you will more easily understand the flow and connection of pleasure, making it easier to climax.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with making climaxing your goal initially; just try to forget about it during your masturbation session. Some people are too impatient and single-mindedly pursue climaxing, which often prevents them from reaching their goal. This is why it's necessary to point out this trap.

#### 7. Climax Pleasure Trap: Believing the First Climax is Always Pleasurable



- **Wrong:** The pleasure of the first climax is overwhelming and can never be surpassed.
- **Right:** A climax may not be very pleasurable at first. The pleasure of a climax can be strengthened with more practice.

This trap can only be avoided with guidance from someone who has already experienced a dry orgasm. The pleasure of a dry orgasm is not inherent but needs to be cultivated over time.

Some readers might ask if this contradicts the earlier statement that "a climax is a byproduct of pleasure." While a climax is almost always directly connected to pleasure, there can be exceptions where the initial experience is not very pleasurable. I want to point out a fact: a climax is an action that instantly increases the pleasure that has been accumulating up to that point; it can't bring much pleasure on its own.

A climax is not always pleasurable. I can confirm this from my own experience. My first climax was a soft blankness in my mind and a strong spasm in my lower back, with almost no pleasure. Because of this, I was discouraged and thought, "This isn't a climax!" But now, my orgasms are comfortable and make me want to gasp. From my physiological reactions and sensations, it is clearly a climax.

Feeling good during a climax is a skill that can be developed, and there is a method for improvement. After my first not-so-pleasurable climax, I practiced repeatedly, accumulated pleasure, and had multiple orgasms, gradually learning how to enhance the pleasure and achieve a climax with a heavenly sense of bliss and satisfaction.

I have been asked many times, "Was this a climax?" which shows that many people have had this experience. I hope you understand that unpleasurable orgasms exist.

**Solution:**

- **View reaching a climax as a milestone, not the end, and start your "climax eroticism development" from there.** The structure of this document reflects this, as the ultimate goal is to achieve an unparalleled pleasurable climax. This document will later detail the "climax eroticism development" period, the key tips for development, and methods for strengthening climax pleasure.

This chapter is now complete. In the next chapter, we will discuss specific nipple development methods, dividing the process into three stages and introducing concrete and effective methods for each stage. Once you achieve a climax, the effectiveness of other development methods also tends to increase.

I will emphasize this one more time: the nipple development methods we will introduce in the next chapter will incorporate improvements for all seven of these common traps. Therefore, you do not need to fully understand and memorize this chapter to develop effectively.
