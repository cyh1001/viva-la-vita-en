# Nipple Dry Orgasm Development

### The Basic Penile Dry Orgasm Method

#### Penile Dry Orgasm



- **Tools:** You basically don't need any, but you can use lubricant.
- Slowly play with your nipples to get your mind into a soft, hazy, melting-like trance-state. (For those who can already have a dry orgasm, having a few mild orgasms at this point will increase your success rate).
- While maintaining that comfortable, melting feeling in your mind, continue playing with your nipples. With your other hand, slowly stroke your penis up and down, feeling the pleasure of the nipples and the stimulation of the penis mix. Stroking too fast can lead to ejaculation, so it's not recommended. A speed of about one stroke every few seconds is more suitable.
- When stroking, playing with the glans is more likely to connect your body to the dry orgasm pleasure mode than stroking the shaft. Using lubricant to tease the glans also makes it easier to achieve a penile dry orgasm.
- When the feeling of ejaculation intensifies, the chance of failure is very high. At this point, temporarily stop stimulating the penis and switch to stimulating the nipples to help your body remember that soft, sweet, dry orgasm pleasure.
- Repeat step 2. If you don't feel the urge to ejaculate anymore, slightly increase the stroking speed to accumulate pleasure. A slower rhythm than your usual masturbation is recommended. Do not go too fast when you're still not used to it. The general criteria for safely increasing the stroking speed are: you don't feel the urge to ejaculate, you feel a comfortable sensation deep in your lower abdomen, and your nipples, waist, and even your entire body feel very good. When pleasure comes from your buttocks and nipples despite stimulating your penis, a penile dry orgasm is likely to succeed.
- As you stroke your penis, the sensation of orgasm—which is very different from the feeling of ejaculation—will gradually increase. Your penis will throb intensely but will not ejaculate. Instead, a dry orgasm will occur. It's not that the penis itself feels good, but rather that the pleasure spreads from the base of the penis to the entire body, leading to wave after wave of orgasms.
- After one successful penile dry orgasm, continue stimulating at the same rhythm, and you will continue to have dry orgasms. After about five orgasms, the pleasure will swell to a level that surpasses even the highest rank of dry orgasms. Your mind will enter a blissful ahegao-like state and you'll continue to climax endlessly.
- Your mind will be filled with a sweet pleasure that can even create a sense of danger. You will be unable to control the blissful, lustful expression on your face. Even with gentle stroking, the orgasms will continue, and you will enter an orgasm paradise.
- The hellish pleasure of a dry orgasm, which can even make you feel a sense of danger, is not so easy to experience in other ways, but a penile dry orgasm can reproduce it with surprising ease.

To successfully achieve a penile dry orgasm, the key is to be able to concentrate pleasure at the base of the penis without increasing the urge to ejaculate.

In normal masturbation, only the penis feels good. But after successfully switching to penile dry orgasm mode, even when you're stimulating the glans, pleasure will accumulate in the base and interior of the penis, as well as deep within your body.

When you first try a penile dry orgasm, it's very easy to fail if you get the feeling of being close to ejaculation or if you feel semen accumulating and surging. So, slowly observe your own feelings and try the steps above.

When I was about to fail, I would also focus on stimulating my nipples. Even if your development has progressed, simply stimulating casually makes it unlikely to succeed. So, until you've successfully achieved your second or third penile dry orgasm, you must concentrate and be serious.

Once you get used to it, after a few penile dry orgasms, even intense stroking will only lead to more dry orgasms. It is possible to end up in a state where you are masturbating, but your mind is filled with the thought, "I want to be a girl ♡♡," and your body keeps climaxing in waves with a girl-like pleasure.

If you can already have a somewhat pleasurable dry orgasm, I recommend trying penile dry orgasm masturbation after having ten or more dry orgasms. The success rate is very high.

The above describes the most basic steps. There are also other very effective methods, such as the "pleasure link method for feminine penile transformation" and the "prostate enhancement version." Try them all and choose the one that suits you best.

### The Pleasure Link Method for Feminine Penile Transformation



This method for developing a penile dry orgasm is recommended for those who can already achieve a dry orgasm by other means.

Using this method, the risk of ejaculation will be reduced, even with intense penis stimulation. It can promote the feminization of the penis, making it a pleasure-only organ, much like the clitoris.

Although you can still ejaculate normally if you want to, when you want to experience a penile dry orgasm, you can turn your penis into a dedicated erogenous zone that can only feel dry orgasm pleasure.

This technique is named after the pleasure link of a dry orgasm. Although it is a simple technique of stimulating the penis during a dry orgasm, there are some critically important key points.



#### The Pleasure Link Method for Feminine Penile Transformation



1. Perform a normal dry orgasm masturbation session and enjoy the feeling of a few climaxes (nipple masturbation is used as an example below).
2. Once you are in a state where you can easily have a dry orgasm, stimulate both your nipples and your penis until just before a climax. Stroking too fast can cause ejaculation, so keep the speed slow.
3. Just before a climax, stop stimulating the penis and only play with the nipples to achieve a dry orgasm.
4. Two seconds after reaching the dry orgasm, stimulate the penis. As you stroke, "smear" the pleasure of the dry orgasm into your brain. By stimulating the penis a few seconds after a dry orgasm, you can enjoy the pleasure without the risk of ejaculation.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4. This will allow your body to adapt to intense stroking without a high risk of ejaculation, transforming your penis into a feminine penis. This development method takes advantage of the phenomenon that if you stroke the penis a few seconds after a dry orgasm, the body will continue to climax like a girl, with very little risk of ejaculation.

The advantage of this method is that, unlike the basic penile dry orgasm, it temporarily removes the restriction of slow stroking and allows for new types of play. Ultimately, if you can achieve a dry orgasm with fast penis stroking, the pleasure will increase dramatically. This is a method to train your body to adapt to that.

By repeating this process, not only will the basic penile dry orgasm become easier, but you will also be able to achieve a more advanced penile dry orgasm.
