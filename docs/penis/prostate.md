### Penile Orgasm with Prostate Enhancement



- **Tools:** You essentially need none, but you can use lubricant.
- Slowly play with your nipples until your mind enters a soft, hazy, melted-like trance.
- Maintain this comfortable, melted state of mind while playing with your nipples. Use your other hand to slowly stroke your penis up and down, feeling the pleasure of the nipples and penis stimulation mix. Stroking too fast can lead to ejaculation, so a slow speed, about one stroke every few seconds, is better.
- When stroking, focusing on the glans is more likely to link your body to the dry orgasm pleasure mode than stroking the shaft. Using lubricant to tease the glans also makes it easier to achieve a penile dry orgasm.
- When you feel pleasure concentrating at the base of your penis, you may be about to enter ejaculation mode. To prevent this, focus your attention on your deep abdomen and prostate.
- While focusing on your prostate, continue to have a dry orgasm and slowly stroke your penis. If you feel almost no urge to ejaculate, or if you feel the following, you can slightly increase the stroking speed. However, there is still a risk of ejaculation, so the speed should be slower than your usual masturbation.
- **Evaluation criteria for safely increasing stroking speed:** You feel pleasure concentrating at the base of your penis, a pleasant warmth in your deep abdomen, your prostate feels comfortable, and pleasure gradually accumulates deep within your penis.
- As you continue to stimulate, you'll feel an orgasm sensation—distinct from ejaculation—gradually intensify. Your penis will throb intensely but will not ejaculate. Instead, a dry orgasm will occur. It's not that the penis itself feels good, but rather that the pleasure spreads from the base of the penis throughout your entire body, leading to wave after wave of orgasms.
- After the first penile dry orgasm, continue to stimulate at the same rhythm, and you will continue to have more. After many orgasms, they will build upon one another, and you will be filled with a thick, sweet, blissful sensation. Your face will contort into an uncontrollable ahegao, and you will achieve a mind-melting, blissful state. With every stroke, your entire body will be overwhelmed with pleasure, and you'll climax uncontrollably.
- **To focus your attention on the prostate, you can gently press the area between the glans and the urethra.** Gently pressing on the swollen glans makes it easier to focus on the base and deep parts of the penis, which helps prevent ejaculation. However, be careful not to apply too much pressure or press on the urethra, as this could increase the risk of ejaculation.
