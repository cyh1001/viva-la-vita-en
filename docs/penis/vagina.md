4. Focus on sensation reception rather than ejaculatory pursuit
5. Allow orgasmic waves during intercourse without ejaculation

### Modified Positioning for Feminine Response
Positions that support feminine orgasm development:

5. Allow feminine orgasmic waves during plateau phases

**Energy Circulation with Partner:**
1. Coordinate breathing with partner's movements
2. Visualize energy flowing between both bodies
3. Use partner's rhythm to enhance energy circulation
4. Focus on shared energy rather than individual stimulation
