# Prostate Development Introduction

### Introduction



People describe a **prostate orgasm** as an amazing pleasure. From anecdotes and shared experiences, we can tell that a prostate orgasm feels like your entire body is being stimulated. This sensation originates from the base of your penis, giving you a warm feeling, and involuntary muscle spasms spread throughout your whole body with a very pleasurable sensation. Compared to a regular ejaculatory orgasm, this type of orgasm is definitely more intense, lasts longer, and has a more prolonged and stronger duration. If you compare a woman's experience during G-spot stimulation with a man's experience during P-spot (prostate) stimulation, you will begin to see many similarities.

This does bring up a matter of subjective opinion. Some people say this orgasm is incredible, some say it is very intense, but others say it is only slightly more pleasurable than a regular ejaculatory orgasm. Some even say the intensity of the orgasm can vary at different times. We can't predict what you will experience, but it should be a very pleasant sensation.

To achieve a prostate orgasm, you only need to stimulate the prostate to cause rhythmic, involuntary contractions. Gentle touch is usually all that is needed to cause these contractions. If you only press on the prostate up and down without causing involuntary rhythmic contractions, you will force the contents of the prostate to flow out. This is commonly referred to as "prostate milking" and is not considered a prostate orgasm. It is an enhanced version of an ejaculatory orgasm, but its intensity is far lower than an orgasm caused by prostate stimulation.

During a prostate orgasm, you may experience small drips of clear or translucent prostatic fluid. A prostate orgasm has no refractory period (but a prostate milking orgasm does), which means you can have multiple orgasms from the prostate, as the prostate replenishes its contents faster than the seminal vesicles. You can also have orgasmic spasms without any prostatic fluid. The sensation of a prostate orgasm usually feels like it originates from somewhere around the abdominal muscles (stomach), followed by involuntary spasms of muscles all around the body, not just in the genital area like with a regular ejaculatory orgasm. They can come in waves and cause full-body muscle spasms, bringing a warm sensation.

Not all prostate massages lead to a prostate orgasm. These orgasms cannot be forced like penile or clitoral orgasms; you need a high level of mental and physical relaxation and proper stimulation. To stimulate the prostate most directly, you must first understand the relevant knowledge of anal development.
