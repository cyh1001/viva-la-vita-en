# Prostate Development Introduction

## Understanding Prostate Orgasms

Regarding prostate orgasms, people describe them as amazing pleasure experiences. From reports and shared experiences, we know that prostate orgasms feel like your entire body is being stimulated. This sensation originates from your penis (but not the tip of the penis, rather from the base of the penis), giving you a warm, enveloping feeling. Involuntary muscle spasms spread throughout your body with an incredibly pleasant sensation.

Compared to ordinary ejaculatory orgasms, this type of orgasm definitely feels more intense, lasts longer, and provides more sustained pleasure. If you compare the experience that women have during G-spot stimulation with the experience that men have during P-spot (i.e., Prostate) stimulation, you'll begin to see great similarities.

## Individual Variation in Experience

This brings up an important point about subjective experience - some people say this kind of orgasm is incredible, some describe it as very intense, but others say this kind of orgasm is only slightly more pleasant than regular ejaculatory orgasms. Some even report having different orgasm intensity levels at different times. We cannot predict what kind of feeling you will experience, but you should find it very pleasant.

## The Mechanics of Prostate Orgasms

To achieve prostate orgasms, you need to stimulate the prostate to produce **rhythmic involuntary contractions**. Usually just a gentle touch can trigger these involuntary contractions. If you simply press up and down on the prostate without triggering involuntary rhythmic contractions, you likely won't experience a prostate orgasm - only some pleasant feelings from prostate massage.

**Key Distinction**: The difference between prostate massage (pleasant but limited) and prostate orgasm (full-body, intense experience) lies in achieving those rhythmic, involuntary contractions.
