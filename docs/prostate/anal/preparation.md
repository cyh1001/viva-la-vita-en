### Diet



To prevent your waste from becoming too liquid-like, please try to avoid the following foods:

- Dairy products (milk, cream, cheese, yogurt, whey protein, etc.)
- Red meat
- Junk/processed foods
- Spicy foods
- Artificial sweeteners
- Caffeine
- Excessive fructose
- Broccoli and cauliflower
- Alcohol

Fiber is unique because it adds bulk to stool, which is great for your digestive system and allows food to pass slowly through the colon. Here is a list of foods that will reduce the frequency of bowel movements:

- **Whole grains:** These are unprocessed foods that contain complex carbohydrates that take a long time to digest, but they also contain fiber. Examples include quinoa, rye, brown rice, lentils, and whole wheat pasta.
- **Vegetables:** Most vegetables contain fiber, for example, carrots, beets, and artichokes.
- **Fruits:** Most fruits also contain fiber, for example, apples, bananas, and oranges.
- **Berries:** For example, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries.
- **Legumes:** For example, white beans, kidney beans, and navy beans.
- **Nuts:** For example, almonds, pistachios, and pecans.
- **Seeds:** For example, chia seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds.
- **Others:** Most unprocessed, raw, and fresh foods contain a lot of fiber.

### Cleaning



There are currently three known cleaning methods, which are listed in order from least to most invasive:

- Sitting on the toilet (defecation)
- Douching
- Enema

You might not consider sitting on the toilet a true cleaning method, but for some people, it's actually enough because of their diet. A less obvious benefit of a good diet is predictable bowel movements. People with a balanced diet can easily predict when they need to defecate. The frequency of bowel movements is something everyone needs to figure out, but knowing this schedule can reduce your need to defecate. You can simply sit on the toilet before anal play to empty your colon in the most natural way. If you are not confident in your bowel movements, then this method may not be for you.

**Douching** is the act of flushing the rectum with liquid (most commonly water). This means the water should not pass through the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ). This is a less invasive and faster cleaning method. Douching can be a bit tricky because you must ensure the water does not pass through the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ). This is not very easy to determine, but most people describe it as a sudden release of pressure in the rectum (which means the water has escaped from the rectum and entered the colon). Whether the water escapes through your RSJ depends on the volume and pressure. So, for douching purposes, you should use a small amount of water and low pressure each time you release liquid into the rectum (a small squirt of water). This method is fast and fairly simple, but there is still a chance that you may accidentally release feces from the colon into the rectum due to relaxation.

**An enema** is the act of flushing the rectum and colon with liquid (most commonly water). The difference from douching is that during an enema, water flows through the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ), allowing for a deeper cleaning. Enemas require special equipment, and the same equipment can be used for both enemas and douching. An enema may seem simple, but it also has some risks because it requires a large amount of water and pressure. In general, the risks come from accidentally creating too much pressure in the rectum and colon, which usually happens with a showerhead enema. This type of enema can produce a very powerful stream of water that can, in some cases, damage the tissues of the colon or rectum. An enema is very invasive because you are flushing a large part of your digestive system with water, which disrupts the microbiome in your intestines. This cleaning method can take a long time, even over an hour for some people.

To perform an enema or douching, you need certain equipment. Here are some common types of equipment you can use:

- **Enema bag:** Place it higher than yourself, insert the lubricated nozzle into the anus, and gravity will push the water into the rectum. You get the best results when lying on your side. This method can be quite slow but may be the safest option of all (it flushes the rectum/colon).
- **Enema bulb:** Squeeze it to suck in water, insert the lubricated nozzle into the anus, and squeeze the bulb again to release the water into the rectum/colon. It can be large or small, and you can easily generate the required pressure (and you may also generate too much pressure, so be careful not to squeeze too hard). It can be quite cumbersome and time-consuming but is easy to transport or store.
- **Enema showerhead attachment:** Replace your showerhead with a special attachment, insert the lubricated nozzle into the anus, and open the valve on the faucet. You can generate a wide variety of water volumes and pressures (be careful and open it slowly so you don't accidentally get a strong stream). This is very cumbersome but can significantly speed up your cleaning time and may be the most thorough cleaning method.
- **Bottle enema attachment:** Fill a plastic bottle with water, replace the cap with a nozzle, insert the lubricated nozzle into the anus, and squeeze the bottle. This is very similar to an enema bulb.

### Lubricant



Most guides on anal sex will advise you to go slow and use a lot of lubricant. The human body does not naturally produce (enough) lubricant for the required slipperiness. As you may know, the vagina produces natural lubricant whenever a woman gets sexually aroused, but this mechanism simply does not exist in the anus or any other part involved in anal sex. Without lubricant, you will not only feel uncomfortable but can also be seriously injured. Therefore, it is very important to use a lot of lubricant.

There are various types of lubricants, and most are suitable for anal sex (with a few exceptions), but it's important to choose the right lubricant depending on the specific activity, whether it's regular penetrative anal sex, dilation, long-term plugging, fisting, or something else. In general, there are four types of lubricants to choose from:

- **Oil-based lubricants:** These are the most slippery and long-lasting lubricants. They are great for long sessions because you don't have to reapply the lube often, but they also have some major drawbacks. They can cause problems with sex toys made from porous materials (like TPR, TPE, or PVC), which can degrade over time and harbor bacteria that are difficult to clean. Oil-based lubricants are messy, and some people may get acne on their skin because some oils can clog skin pores. That being said, oil-based lubricants are very slippery and long-lasting, so they are the preferred lubricant for those who engage in more advanced anal sex, like fisting. Remember to wash your sex toys after using an oil-based lubricant. It is not recommended to use oil-based lubricants for vaginal sex.
  - **Important note:** It is not recommended to use oil-based lubricants with condoms. In some cases, you may find that oil-based lubricants can degrade and eventually break the condom. Some oil-based lubricants are compatible with certain condoms, and it's best to check the manufacturer's website to ensure their product is compatible.
- **Water-based lubricants:** These are very slippery but dry out quickly and need to be reapplied often. They wash off easily, are inexpensive, and most people don't have any skin problems with them. These lubricants can be used with any type of sex toy, but you still need to wash your sex toys after use. This is the most popular choice for those who frequently engage in anal sex. Some people may experience irritation from water-based lubricants, which may be caused by glycerin. If this is the case, then consider looking for glycerin-free lubricants. Water-based lubricants are the standard for anal sex.
- **Silicone-based lubricants:** These are lubricants made primarily from silicone. These lubricants are somewhere between oil-based and water-based. They are more slippery than water-based lubricants, are hypoallergenic (meaning they are less likely to cause an allergic reaction), don't need to be reapplied as often, and are easier to wash off than oil-based lubricants. Remember to wash your sex toys after use.
- **Hybrid lubricants:** These are a mix of silicone and water-based lubricants, and they tend to combine the best of both. They wash off easily, are slippery, and last a long time. This particular type of lubricant is rarely advertised. Remember to wash your sex toys after use.

Many beginners overlook the importance of lubricant. A general rule of thumb is that you can never use too much lube. The disadvantage of not using enough lube is potential injury and discomfort, but the disadvantage of using too much lube is just more mess. This comparison should make you realize that it's better to be safe than sorry.

**Note:** Saliva is not a suitable lubricant. You need a proper lubricant.
