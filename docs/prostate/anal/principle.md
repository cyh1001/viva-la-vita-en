### Orgasm



First, we must acknowledge that the anus is full of nerve endings, which means that any stimulation around it is immediately felt. The area surrounding the rectum is also full of nerve endings, but the inner wall of the rectum leads to organs that can receive stimulation through the rectum. During anal intercourse with a partner, the receiver should contract their PC muscles. These contractions will feel like a squeezing sensation to the inserter. Many men enjoy the stimulation of being squeezed in the rectum, and these PC muscle contractions increase the receiver's chances of reaching orgasm. This is regardless of gender, as both men and women perform these contractions to stimulate the surrounding organs and nerves.

From an anatomical perspective, it seems to make little sense to stimulate the deep parts of the rectum. For women, the A-spot (a sensitive area located deep in the front wall of the vagina, close to the cervix, which can trigger deep pleasure and intense orgasms) and G-spot (located on the front wall of the vagina, about 3 to 5 cm from the entrance, near the urethra. The G-spot is also a very sensitive area that, when properly stimulated, can trigger intense sexual pleasure and even lead to female ejaculation in some women) are very close to the anus. For men, the P-spot (the prostate is called the male "P-spot," and stimulating it can trigger intense sexual pleasure, sometimes called a "prostate orgasm") and seminal vesicles are also very close to the anus and should be able to produce a sensation through the stimulation of deeper tissues in the rectum. There are many nerve bundles called the pelvic plexus around the rectum that seem to be able to hijack the stimulation and cause the sensation of the genital organs being directly stimulated. They also seem to be responsible for sending signals of sexual arousal to the brain. A similar phenomenon is seen in some people who sneeze when they see bright sunlight, an effect called the photic sneeze reflex. A similar effect seems to exist in anal sex.

To achieve orgasm, it is crucial to first address any stressors. Many of us have complicated situations in our daily lives that can prevent us from enjoying sex. This is especially true for men, as most who cannot enjoy anal stimulation are dealing with stress. Before engaging in anal sex, consider all possible ways to eliminate stressors. If you are worried that someone will hear you, play some music. If you are worried about making a mess, use an enema to clean yourself out and put a towel down. Men are often insecure about what their partner thinks and how it affects their masculinity. In these cases, the partner must reassure them that this will not affect anything outside the bedroom. If the stress is caused by more complex issues, then seek solutions to those problems first. You must stop yourself from feeling anxious during anal sex.

You can see many different techniques for achieving orgasm in the content below, but remember that the key is rhythmic internal contractions.

### Orgasm (Female)



The female pudendal nerve runs deep into the vaginal lips (labia minora/majora), through the PC muscles, and along the rectum, passing through the spine. When we try to understand female anal orgasm, we often simply assume that stimulating this nerve "stimulates" the clitoris or cervix. Women tend to describe anal stimulation as feeling like their primary genitals are being stimulated. The hypogastric nerve is connected to the genital organs, and some sources suggest that both of these nerves are involved in female orgasm, leading to trembling, muscle spasms, and so on. This means that by stimulating both of these nerves, you should be able to trigger an orgasm, and the way the pudendal nerve is distributed along the outer part of the anus also makes anal sex a promising way to produce a sensual orgasm (the nerve endings are closer to the anus than in men).

You are most likely to trigger an orgasm if you stimulate the A-spot and G-spot (and other spots) at the same time, but they are far apart. To have the best chance of getting proper stimulation, you should angle the penis or sex toy at about a 45-degree angle. But remember that too much force can cause a lot of discomfort and even injury. For optimal insertion stimulation, consider using a soft silicone toy instead of a hard metal or glass one. A soft toy will tend to adapt to the curvature of the rectum and increase the chances of stimulating all the spots in one insertion. If you do want to use a hard toy, then consider using a "rocking" motion instead of thrusting. This allows the tip of the toy to hit multiple erogenous zones by rocking your hips. When these erogenous zones are stimulated, you can consciously contract your pelvic floor muscles (PC muscles), and eventually they will contract automatically, leading to orgasm.

**Note:** It is difficult for women to orgasm with their legs spread wide. With the legs together, there is a better chance of stimulating the crura of the clitoris (part of the erectile tissue connected to the clitoris).

### Orgasm (Male)



**Prostate Orgasm:** This is the type of orgasm you are most likely looking for. To achieve a prostate orgasm, you only need to stimulate the prostate to cause rhythmic, involuntary contractions. Gentle touch is usually all that is needed to cause these contractions. If you only press on the prostate up and down without causing involuntary rhythmic contractions, you will force the contents of the prostate to flow out. This is commonly referred to as "prostate milking" and is not considered a prostate orgasm. It is an enhanced version of an ejaculatory orgasm, but its intensity is far lower than an orgasm caused by prostate stimulation. During a prostate orgasm, you may experience small drips of clear or translucent prostatic fluid. A prostate orgasm has no refractory period (but a prostate milking orgasm does), which means you can have multiple orgasms from the prostate, as the prostate replenishes its contents faster than the seminal vesicles. You can also have orgasmic spasms without any prostatic fluid. The sensation of a prostate orgasm usually feels like it originates from somewhere around the abdominal muscles (stomach), followed by involuntary muscle spasms all around the body, not just in the genital area like with a regular ejaculatory orgasm. They can come in waves and cause full-body muscle spasms, bringing a warm sensation. Not all prostate massages lead to a prostate orgasm. These orgasms cannot be forced like penile or clitoral orgasms; you need a high level of mental and physical relaxation and proper stimulation.

**Anal Orgasm:** This type of orgasm originates from the anal sphincter and rectum itself, rather than the abdominal muscle area or genital area. The orgasm can be described as a trembling around the body that makes you shiver, but not with muscle spasms. If you remove the sex toy or penis during this type of orgasm, you will notice how the anus involuntarily contracts and relaxes. It seems that you can increase your chances of achieving this type of orgasm through rhythmic breathing (short exhales from the stomach through the throat). Anal orgasms usually do not involve the prostate or seminal vesicles leaking any type of fluid, and they have no refractory period.

The base of the prostate is typically located about 5 cm inside the rectum, and the top is typically located about 10 cm inside the rectum, with most people finding the top to be the most pleasurable. The prostate fills with fluid and gets larger when you are fully aroused. You should find a way to get yourself as aroused as possible to locate the most likely position of the prostate. Above the prostate, you will find the seminal vesicles, and directly above the seminal vesicles is the bladder. Some people describe the top of the prostate as a "hump" or a "ridge," which is the highest point you can reach without stimulating the bladder and causing the urge to urinate.

You can use a dildo that is half-inserted (you should know by now that the prostate is not actually deep in the rectum) and use the tip of the dildo to locate the various spots. The first area you are most likely to find is the seminal vesicles, which are a little deeper than the prostate. This area will feel very comfortable. Some people describe a similar experience when they are about to ejaculate (but the initial level of stimulation is much smaller). The second area you are most likely to find is the bladder, which is a little deeper than the seminal vesicles. Stimulating this area will give you the urge to pee. From this, you can have a simple plan: if you feel the urge to urinate, then move down a little. If you don't feel a pleasurable stimulation, then move up a little. But if you still don't feel anything, then you can consider getting yourself more aroused in other ways first. Most people prefer to aim for the area between the seminal vesicles and the prostate because you tend not to over-stimulate these two areas. Some people suggest aiming the shaft of the dildo at the seminal vesicles and letting the realistic head of the dildo rub the prostate as you insert the sex toy. This stimulation should feel like the start of ejaculation or urination.

Common indicators of finding the prostate are the urge to urinate or the feeling of being on the verge of ejaculation, but nothing seems to come out. This is because the urethra runs through the center of the prostate. If you engage in deeper anal play, then you can experience the deeper internal areas where you will feel a stronger urge to urinate. This is likely your bladder, and you need to move the stimulation more centrally at the shallow end of the rectum. The prostate becomes more engorged when you are about to ejaculate because fluid from the seminal vesicles is emptied into it. Overall, patience and gentle pressure are important, but a high level of sexual arousal is also crucial. The prostate should not be hard; it has a "spongy" texture.

When using a sex toy or penis to stimulate the prostate, the angle should be about 45 to 75 degrees toward the abdomen because the prostate is angled toward the abdomen. You can even try leaning back, so your body is at a 120-degree angle (which most men find most comfortable), and using a rocking motion. At the same time, with muscle contractions, the puborectalis and PC muscles pull the sex toy (or penis) toward the prostate, and the bulbospongiosus muscle helps push fluid from the prostate through the urethra. Some people like to use a sex toy or penis for insertion at a similar angle.

To stimulate the prostate, you need to perform a very gentle insertion (or tapping), apply very gentle pressure, and make very short contact. The start of prostate stimulation must be very slow and gentle, with small movements. The stimulation must maintain the same speed and pressure; you cannot change it at will. Allow the prostate to adapt to the stimulation. The prostate cannot climax in the same way as the penis. For beginners, it's recommended to first use a toy like the Aneros to understand the required pressure. Imagine rubbing your eyeball with your eyelids closed; this is the same pressure you should apply to the prostate. Applying too much pressure can actually bruise the prostate. Stimulating the prostate should never be painful, so if you do feel pain, then either you are applying too much pressure, you are trying to stimulate the urethra below the prostate (either way, you're applying too much pressure), or there is some underlying issue that requires medical attention.

A chastity cage can help men achieve a prostate orgasm. It not only allows prostatic fluid to accumulate but also gives you a slight pulsating stimulation from the penis. When you wear a chastity cage, your penis will come into contact with certain parts of the cage, but when you contract your PC muscles, you also involve the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles, which are responsible for sending blood to your erectile tissue to create an erection. Combining PC muscle contractions with gentle pressure on the prostate and the slight pulsating penile stimulation can cause a synchronized stimulation that may trigger a prostate orgasm.

**Note:** Anesthetizing the penis will most likely prevent you from achieving a prostate orgasm. Anesthetic creams (like lidocaine cream) will numb the pudendal nerves that run through the area near the prostate. This cream will also numb the urethra, preventing you from feeling the sensation of orgasm. When stimulating the penis directly, you create a very strong stimulus, and the anesthetic is likely not to numb the nerves, so you won't feel anything, but the prostate is very sensitive and needs the surrounding nerves and tissues to also be sensitive. If you want to stop yourself from stimulating the penis, then it's better to use a chastity cage or similar device. Some people seem to have a fantasy of no longer getting an erection and fully committing to anal stimulation. They even start using Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for this, but you must remember that this invasive method is very likely to reduce the sensation of prostate massage.

**Note:** Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) affects the degree of stimulation from prostate massage. Men who start HRT may find the sensation of prostate stimulation less intense.

**Note:** Abstaining from masturbation can help achieve a prostate orgasm. Or, you may get the best results by regularly masturbating, then abstaining for one to two days before massaging the prostate. But this method does not work for everyone.
