# Anal Exploration Step-by-Step Guide

### Basic Steps



**Warning:** This chapter omits many details and only provides the fastest yet still safe way to get into anal sex. It is highly recommended that you read the entire guide in full.

**Steps:**

1. **Start with Touch:** Not everyone enjoys anal sex, but many can learn to. Start by touching your anus in the shower for a few days. Gently press on the anus to get used to the feeling. Rub around the anus with your fingers, but don't insert your finger yet. **Key point:** This is to get you used to the feeling of something touching your butt. **Note:** Enemas or douching are not suitable for this stage. Doing this in the shower allows you to wash away any fecal matter. Avoid enemas or douching for now.
2. **Choose the Right Lube:** Lube is a must. Do not use soap. Do not use saliva. You must use lube, otherwise, you are very likely to injure yourself and get no pleasure at all. When it comes to lube, there are many types, but for simplicity, just buy a suitable water-based lube. Check reviews in your area or online. You don't need to buy the best lube; almost any water-based lube will do. **Key point:** Buy a water-based lube. Any lube from a trustworthy store will work for now.
3. **Cleanliness:** First, do not use an enema or douche for now. Plan your diet in the days leading up to anal sex. Avoid spicy foods, junk food, and pre-processed foods. Eat foods rich in fiber in the days leading up to anal sex. On the day you plan to have anal sex, simply go to the toilet as usual to empty your colon. **Key point:** Maintain a good diet in the days leading up to anal sex, go to the toilet, and do not use an enema or douche.
4. **Insert One (or Two) Fingers:** After a few days of touching your anus in the shower, you can start using your fingers. Apply a generous amount of lube to one of your fingers. Start to insert your finger into the anus, but don't force it. Try to insert just the tip of your finger and then clench your anus until you can feel a slight squeeze on your finger. Hold the clench for a few seconds, then relax your anus. Once you start to relax your anus, you should notice that your finger can almost slide in automatically. Repeat the clenching process until you have inserted your finger into the anus. Leave your finger inside for a while, and then try to move it around inside, twist it, and gently push in. Then try two fingers. **Key point:** Get used to the feeling of having something inside your anus.
5. **Choose the Right Dildo:** Choose a small dildo (with a top diameter of less than 3 cm to start) made from a quality material (silicone, stainless steel, glass; do not buy other materials until you know more). Butt plugs can be used, but it's recommended to start with a dildo. Realistic dildos are fine, hard dildos are fine, and beaded dildos are fine. The shape doesn't matter as long as it's small. Do not use everyday objects; the risk of injury or infection is too high. **Key point:** Choose a small dildo. **Note:** Silicone dildos are usually the preferred choice, although you may want to start with a stainless steel or glass dildo. Hard sex toys have many negative effects, but silicone sex toys tend to leave a distinct odor when used for anal sex.
6. **Use the Dildo for Anal Development:** Step one, maintain good eating habits, go to the toilet to clean out your colon before anal development, and do not use an enema or douche. It's best to do this in the shower. Apply lube to your finger and slowly insert one finger into the anus, using the anal clench method if necessary. Twist your finger and pull it to the sides to gently stretch the anus. Insert another lubed finger and repeat. Slowly try three fingers, and don't forget to add lube. When you are ready, apply lube to the dildo and slowly insert it into the anus, using the anal clench method if necessary. You don't need to insert the dildo deep; a few centimeters is enough for now. Leave the dildo in your rectum for a while. Try to pull the dildo to the sides, and try to make small pushes. **Key point:** Warm up the anal muscles with your fingers, use lube, slowly insert the dildo into the rectum, and then gradually make small pushes. **Note:** If you are a beginner, never try to insert a dildo without warming up. Use your fingers and the anal clench method to prepare for something bigger.
7. **Listen to Your Body's Reactions:** Anal sex should not be painful; it should be pleasurable. If you feel pain or even discomfort, it means your body is trying to signal to you that something is wrong. Listen to these feelings; they are crucial. Whenever you feel pain, it means you need to stop and try another method. Do not continue with the current action and wait for the pain to go away, or you may end up in the hospital. Bleeding means you must stop immediately, no questions asked. Dark blood means you really need to see a doctorâ€”go right away! **Key point:** Pain means you're doing something wrong. Stop it. **Note:** The internet is full of bad advice. One of the worst pieces of advice you can find is "you will get used to the pain." Do not believe such advice, and do not trust people who propose such reckless behavior.
8. **Continue with Anal Development:** As usual, maintain good eating habits, go to the toilet before development, and do not use an enema or douche. It's best to do this in the shower. Repeat the steps described in stage 7, but when inserting the dildo, you should slowly start to stimulate yourself in a traditional way (penis/clitoris/vagina). If you can, try to have an orgasm. Repeat this a few times until you start to feel pleasure in your anus. Don't make the anal stimulation too fast or too hard, and don't go too deep, or it won't be as pleasurable as traditional masturbation. **Key point:** Incorporate anal development into your traditional masturbation, and be gentle. **Note:** It is very important to ease into anal development. You need to train your body to associate anal development with pleasure, which takes time and a lot of practice. Don't rush. When you climax in a traditional way, you don't have to move the dildo.
9. **Clean the Bowels:** Only when you start to feel that anal sex is good can you choose to clean yourself with water or a weak saline solution before anal sex (this is an option, not a must). Do not use an enema at this stage. An enema uses a lot of water, but you only need to find a very small enema bulb and use a very small amount of liquid (no more than 100 ml; yes, that little). Before douching, go to the toilet to empty your colon. Fill the enema bulb with no more than 100 ml of liquid. Apply lube to the nozzle of the bulb and insert it into the anus. Squeeze half of the bulb and let the liquid stay in the rectum for a while. You can jump and wiggle a little. Sit on the toilet and release all the liquid. Repeat the process with the remaining liquid in the bulb. Release all remaining residue in the toilet for about 30 minutes. **Key point:** Don't use too much liquid. Squeeze a little liquid in, then release it. **Note:** An enema or using more than 100 ml of liquid is not for beginners. Focusing on a healthy diet is more important than flushing with a large amount of liquid. A large amount of liquid can cause nausea and turn a few-minute douching process into an uncomfortable process that lasts for hours.
10. **More Anal Sex Practice:** At this point, you should be able to call on your anal muscles and incorporate anal sex into your regular masturbation. During anal sex, you may still have the urge to go to the toilet. This is a natural reflex that will disappear with practice. Continue to practice dildo insertion during masturbation, and in the next practice, slowly pay more attention to the feeling in the anus. Repeat this many times until you no longer have the urge to push the dildo out. **Key point:** Keep practicing anal sex and learn to suppress the urge to push out. **Note:** If you are worried about making a mess, consider putting a towel down. Anal sex can be messy, so slowly get used to it.
11. **Anal Sex with a Partner:** Only now are you just getting started. You can choose whether or not to use a douche. Warm up your anal muscles with your fingers and dildo as usual; do not skip the warm-up step. Be sure to use lube. Guide your partner to start slowly and guide them to find the perfect speed, depth, and position until you are comfortable. By adding penile/clitoral stimulation while you are being inserted, you can discover that anal sex has even more pleasure. Don't worry about making a mess. **Key point:** Warm-up! Warm-up! Take it slow, be gentle, and enjoy it.

**Warning:** Never switch from anal sex to vaginal sex in the same session. The risk of infection is extremely high. You can switch from vaginal sex to anal sex, but not the other way around.

**Tip:** Urinate after anal sex (both partners) to reduce the risk of infection.
