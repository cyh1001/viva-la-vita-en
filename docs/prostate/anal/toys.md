# Toys

### Types



- **Dildos:** It is very important to choose a dildo that isn't completely smooth, which might seem counterintuitive because rectal tissue is fragile. However, a surface with no texture will reduce stimulation. Therefore, the best choice is a realistic dildo with very prominent veins and a head. Make sure you choose a dildo with a flared base to reduce the risk of it accidentally slipping entirely into the anus.
- **Vibrators:** These are often smooth, which makes most vibrators unsuitable for anal sex. However, this doesn't mean they can't be used. Although this type of toy is more suited for women and vaginal sex, you can still get stimulation from the vibrations. Vibrators rarely have a flared base, which makes them somewhat dangerous to use for anal sex, as they could slip in too deep to be retrieved.
- **Butt Plugs:** These are sex toys specifically designed for anal sex. They are useful for both men and women because they create internal pressure in your rectum and stretch your anal sphincter muscles, which many people find very erotic. These toys are even used for "long-term wear," where you can leave a butt plug in for hours or even days, but this requires a very specific type of butt plug.
- **Dilators:** These can be used to train your anal sphincter muscles to accommodate larger objects.
- **Anal Beads:** This type of sex toy creates stimulation by repeatedly stretching your anal sphincter muscles as you insert or remove the toy. While this toy may not provide as much stimulation as a dildo, the feeling of the anal sphincter opening and closing is very intense, and many people enjoy it.
- **Prostate Massagers:** These sex toys are specifically designed for men to stimulate the prostate.
- **Speculums:** These are medical devices used by doctors to gain access to the rectum (or cervix) for surgery. Speculums are not suitable for beginners, as it's easy to injure yourself by over-dilating the anal sphincter.
- **Fists:** This type of toy should only be used by the most advanced users. Many people find the immense pressure created by the size and shape of the knuckles to be very stimulating.
- **Depth Probes:** These depth probes are very flexible and very long (20cm+). Their diameter is usually not large (typically around 4cm, which is the tightest point for most people's colons). The purpose of this specific sex toy is to slowly slide into your colon with minimal friction. Because the toy is very flexible, it easily adapts to the curvature of your colon.
- **Wearable Straps:** Similar to underwear, these allow you to mount a sex toy in front of you. Their purpose is to allow a woman (or, in some cases, a man) to be the inserter in anal sex, rather than just the receiver.
- **Wands:** This is a sex toy designed for vaginal sex. Unfortunately, the vibration and shape of this toy will not provide more stimulation than a regular vibrator.
- **Fucking Machines:** These devices can be very rough and are very dangerous to use. An accidental turn of a knob can immediately thrust into your rectum with full force and cause serious injury. Fucking machines are not for beginners.
- **Enema Bags:** Some people find it very stimulating to have water inserted into their body because it creates a distributed pressure in many areas of the rectum and colon. Enema bags are much safer than showerhead attachments because the water pressure is not strong enough to cause injury.
- **Inflatable Toys:** They are an excellent tool for replacing many different-sized sex toys used in anal training, as a single inflatable toy can save space. However, this does come with risks. Try not to inflate them while they are inside your body. The best way to use an inflatable toy is to inflate it before insertion and then play with it like a regular dildo or butt plug.

**Important Note:** Some people will think of using various household items as sex toys, but there is a risk of injury and poisoning. We do not recommend using any household items as sex toys. If you absolutely must risk using an item as a sex toy, at least consider using a condom to reduce the chance of injury, but remember that even condoms can break. Whatever your reason for not buying a dedicated sex toy, please consider finding a way to purchase high-quality sex toys that can be used for years. Sex toys are specifically designed to provide maximum pleasure, while household items are not.

### Materials



Below you can find the most common types of materials that may be toxic:

- **TPR/TPE:** This is the most common material in sex shops. It is porous, and these toys have a very unique and strong smell. They are usually very cheap. Older sex toys are likely to contain phthalates, while newer generations of TPR/TPE sex toys may not.
- **PVC:** This is a cheap and porous material. These toys have a very unique and strong smell and are very likely to contain phthalates.
- **Fanta Flesh/CyberSkin:** This material feels like real skin, but it is very porous.
- **Jelly:** This is a common material because it is very flexible and cheap, but it is very porous.
- **Latex:** Latex does not seem to have the same risks as porous toys or toys containing phthalates, but many people have allergic reactions to latex, which can cause rashes, pimples, or even burns. First, make sure you are not allergic to latex.
- **Metal:** This material is non-porous and usually smooth, but low-quality metals can be toxic, so there is a risk. Cheap toys are often made of metal of questionable quality and should be avoided.

**Note:** Some people do buy sex toys made with these materials and treat them as disposable. They use them a few times and then throw them away because it's impossible to clean them properly. If you really like a toy, then put a condom on it.

Most toys you find will actually contain one of these materials, which makes finding a good sex toy complicated. Fortunately, there are several materials that are considered safe:

- **Silicone:** This is the preferred material for all sex toys. It is easy to clean, can be boiled (for cleaning), and is very soft. Toys are usually very expensive because the material is non-porous and heavy. Make sure you buy a high-quality silicone toy, as cheap silicone is not safe for the body.
- **ABS Plastic:** This is a cheap but safe material to use. It is not a very smooth material and requires a lot of lubricant. It is usually very hard and not soft at all.
- **Glass:** This is a very smooth material that doesn't require a lot of lubricant. It is non-porous and easy to clean, can be boiled (for cleaning), but is usually very expensive and not soft at all. There is also a slight risk of the toy breaking.
- **Wood:** This is not a common material for sex toys, but as long as the surface of the wood is smooth, it is not porous. They are easy to clean, can be boiled (for cleaning), and are completely inflexible. It may be hard to find them now.
- **Metal:** As long as you know the metal is high quality, it can be a safe material. The price can be quite expensive.

**Note:** If you feel a burning sensation, want to remove the sex toy, or experience general irritation, you may be allergic to the material of the sex toy. It's better to spend a little more on a platinum-cured silicone toy than to buy multiple plastic sex toys and then find out you are allergic to them or that they cause infections.
