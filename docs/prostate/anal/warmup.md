# Warmup

### Warm-up

Warming up is crucial in anal play. It will determine whether your experience is a frustrating and uncomfortable one, or an unforgettable and pleasant one. With time and experience, you can develop your own routine, but for beginners, it is very important to take extra time to ensure you are ready.

While there are many possible warm-up routines, we will only focus on a few, as they seem to be the most popular and best suited for beginners. These methods can also help more experienced people. There is no strict time limit for warming up, but you should spend at least 5 minutes on it. Beginners should take more time, or until they can easily insert at least two fingers into their anus. This is not your goal, but an indicator that you can proceed to the next stage of the warm-up.

**Note:** Don't forget to use lubricant in every step of the warm-up!

Let's divide the warm-up into three stages:

- **Anal Sphincter Warm-up**
- **Rectal Warm-up**
- **Rectosigmoid Junction Warm-up** (may not be necessary, depending on the desired depth of insertion)

### Anal Sphincter Warm-up



In the first stage, you should focus on your anal sphincter muscles, making sure they are relaxed. This stage can be considered complete when you can insert at least two or more fingers into your anus with almost no effort; the fingers should just slide in. If you plan to insert a larger toy, you can consider starting with a very small diameter (one or two fingers) and gradually increasing the diameter to be close to your target diameter (all your fingers, part of your fist, or even your whole fist. You can also use various toys of different diameters). Below, we will introduce several methods you can use to warm up your anal sphincter. You can choose one method or a combination of several.

- **The Squeeze Method:** This method requires you to first relax your external anal sphincter and let your fingers partially enter the anus to reach the internal anal sphincter. When the fingers are partially in, start squeezing your anus as hard as you can for a few seconds, then stop squeezing to relax the muscles. When you stop squeezing, you should feel your fingers slide into the internal anal sphincter with almost no pressure. Some people describe this as their fingers being sucked in by the anus. After your fingers pass the internal sphincter, start pulling your fingers to one side (upward or sideways). You should notice that the anus can stretch to a greater extent. When you feel the anus is stretched open, repeat the process with two fingers. You can repeat the process with more fingers or even a sex toy. This method is great for beginners because it's very simple and hard to get wrong.
- **The Pinch Method:** A more advanced method that requires stretching and relaxing both the internal and external anal sphincters. (Consider doing the Squeeze Method first). To perform this method, you should get into a doggy-style position and lie face down. Reach back to your anus with one hand, insert your index and middle fingers into the external anal sphincter, and place your thumb on the outside of the anus. Start gently pinching the external anal sphincter and continue the pinching motion around the anus. You can also use a rubbing motion or a tapping motion or any motion you find more comfortable. While pinching, create a slight rocking motion by moving your body slightly back and forth. After a while, you should be able to feel air entering the rectum, and you should feel that your two anal sphincters are completely relaxed and open.
- **The Fart Method:** This method should be used in conjunction with another method. First, open your anus. (The Pinch Method is recommended, but other methods also work). To start the warm-up, you need to get into a doggy-style position, face down, and use one of the methods above to start stretching the anus until you feel the rectum is filled with air. Inhale through your mouth (using your abdominal cavity and diaphragm to inhale), so your abdominal muscles will hang down toward the floor, allowing the rectum/colon to suck in more air. When you are full of air, use your abdominal muscles again to push the air out. You should be able to hear a loud fart. Try to make the sound louder, but do not create pressure on the rectum by contracting the surrounding muscles; only use your abdominal cavity. If your anus closes again, repeat one of the methods above to open it again. This method can prepare your body for very deep anal play. It can also be used to warm up your rectum and rectosigmoid junction because it relaxes all these areas.

### Rectal Warm-up



After we have dilated your internal and external anal sphincters, you should be able to insert your desired sex toy or penis without pain or discomfort and with almost no effort. Instead, you should feel a very pleasant sensation when you insert an object into your anus. But when you try to insert the object deeper, you may feel some discomfort. To alleviate the discomfort, we must warm up the rectum. But instead of stretching it wide, we must focus on making it "straighter." The rectum is an angled S-shape. The straightening process can only work to a certain extent, but it's enough to alleviate discomfort. Below you can find two methods that can be used to warm up the rectum.

- **The Dildo Method:** Your rectum is at an angle, but if you insert a toy with the angle of the base pointing toward the penis/vagina (i.e., you hold the end of the toy more tilted toward the penis, vagina, and the front of your body rather than straight), it will be easier to insert the toy. Slowly insert the sex toy at an angle and leave it in the rectum for a while. After a while, you should feel a slight relief of discomfort. At this point, you can start to "rock" the toy in all directions, as if you are trying to stretch the rectum in all directions. This twisting motion is to try to straighten the transverse folds of the anofrectal. A common problem for beginners is that they have a strong urge to push the object out during anal sex. In many cases, this discomfort is caused by improper rectal warm-up. To reduce the pressure on the transverse folds from the external object, continue to use your sex toy (preferably a straight one) in a twisting motion, pause for a bit to let your body adapt to the external object, continue to twist, and gradually add short, slow strokes. Then slowly start to insert. After a while, you should feel the sex toy enter your rectum without any discomfort.
- **The Butt Plug Method:** Some people have had great success with a very specific butt plug. Apparently, it works by applying slight pressure to the transverse folds to keep them straight. The exact toy is called "Doc Johnson Mood - Naughty 2 XL." Pay special attention to the name and size, as this is very important. Other models and sizes do not seem to have this effect. The butt plug is 15 cm (6 inches) long and 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) wide. This is not a small toy, and not everyone can use it. This toy is also a good way to warm up the anal sphincter, but in general, this toy is not very suitable for beginners. To warm up with this toy, simply insert the toy slowly into the anus and fully insert it, paying attention to the tilt of the toy so that it matches the natural angle of the rectum. The disadvantage of this method is that it may take you 30 minutes or even an hour to feel the effect, but you can use this toy freely when you are not fully focused on anal sex. This means you can insert the toy long before anal sex and get the warm-up effect. If you have not had a complete enema, be aware that it may activate the rectosigmoid junction.

### Rectosigmoid Junction Warm-up



When your rectum is warmed up, you can proceed to real anal sex. But if you are interested in deep anal play, you need to perform the final warm-up stage. Deep play here refers to any sex toy that reaches the rectosigmoid junction. Remember that the length of the rectum ranges from 15 cm to 30 cm, and you can determine your length by simply trying objects of different lengths. The rectosigmoid junction is a very sharp bend caused by the colon being in a resting state. But if you insert a straight sex toy into the rectum, the tip of the toy may start to "poke" the rectal wall and cause a lot of discomfort. To eliminate this discomfort, you need to learn to relax the colon so that the bend created by the rectosigmoid junction is not so sharp. Unfortunately, this muscle cannot be controlled on demand, but people have learned to control it indirectly.

Relaxing the colon requires practice. First, let's remember that a squatting position is great for aligning the colon with the rectum. You can use this position to widen the angle of the rectosigmoid junction and start using a longer sex toy to insert it near the rectosigmoid junction. Carefully start to move the toy, but do not use too much force, as the area beyond the rectosigmoid junction is more fragile and does not have many nerve endings, which means it's easy to cause injury. You can leave the sex toy there for a while to let your body adapt to the foreign object. The goal here is not to push the toy through the rectosigmoid junction, but to have it stay near the junction and let your body relax the colon in the presence of the foreign object.

Another thing you can take advantage of is a slight clench. Your body will react to a clenching motion because it is a signal that you want to defecate, which will trigger a chain reaction of relaxing the colon, relaxing the transverse folds, relaxing the anal sphincter, and other changes. But this only works if you don't apply too much pressure. Many people also use this method during anal sex. They will push the foreign object slightly outward (imagine the slight clench you feel when you relax your anal sphincter while sitting).

Another adjustment you can make is to get into a posture where you are in a half-squat/half-doggy-style position and look back over your right shoulder while twisting your body. This aligns the rectosigmoid junction with the anus and reduces the anofrectal angle. The half-squat position gives you a slight advantage because you can align the colon in all directions, although it's not as effective as a full squat. When in a doggy-style anal sex position, you may find it useful to move your line of sight over your right shoulder, as this posture can also align the colon and straighten the rectosigmoid junction (do not hunch your back).

Finally, we recommend using a very soft and flexible sex toy to insert into the rectosigmoid junction, but this must be done after you have started to relax the colon. You cannot forcefully insert a sex toy into the rectosigmoid junction, as this will put a lot of pressure on the muscles and colon. You must straighten the rectosigmoid junction in other ways before you insert the toy. The purpose of this is not to insert the toy but to gently slide it past the rectosigmoid junction and let the toy stay there.

**Important note:** Do not make any sudden movements or sudden muscle contractions after you have inserted a sex toy into the rectosigmoid junction. The sex toy will prevent your colon from fully forming the angle of the rectosigmoid junction and will put a lot of pressure on the muscles. This can cause severe pain and injury.

At this point, you should have relaxed and warmed up your internal and external anal sphincters, your rectum, and even your colon, depending on your choice. You should be able to insert your desired sex toy, penis, or fist, but if you cannot, it means you have not warmed up enough or your sex toy is causing stimulation. If you feel the urge to push the sex toy or penis out, then something is wrong. This discomfort is unlikely to go away on its own, and you should re-evaluate your warm-up routine and try again.
