## Personal

### What is the Best Lubricant to Use?

Lubrication is always a frequently discussed topic, and what works best will be a personal decision.

For detailed information, please refer to the lubrication section in the preparation guides.

## Common Concerns

### How Long Does It Take to Experience Results?

The timeline varies greatly between individuals. Some may experience sensations within weeks, while others may need months of practice. Patience and consistency are key factors in development.

### Is It Normal to Feel Nothing at First?

Yes, it's completely normal to feel little or no sensation during initial sessions. The body needs time to develop sensitivity and learn to respond to this type of stimulation.

### What If I Don't Experience Orgasms?

Not everyone will experience intense orgasms, and that's perfectly normal. Focus on the journey and any pleasant sensations rather than specific outcomes.

### How Often Should I Practice?

Quality is more important than quantity. Many find that practicing 2-3 times per week with adequate rest between sessions works well.

### Can This Affect Normal Sexual Function?

When practiced safely, prostate stimulation should not negatively affect normal sexual function. Many report enhanced overall sexual experiences.

## Technical Questions

### What Size Should I Start With?

Begin with smaller toys designed for beginners. The body needs time to accommodate larger sizes safely and comfortably.

### How Much Lubricant Should I Use?

Use generous amounts and reapply as needed. More lubricant is always better than too little.

### What Position Works Best?

This varies by individual. Common positions include lying on your side, on your back, or sitting. Experiment to find what's most comfortable.
