- Sexual practices don't determine sexual identity

### Myth: "Real Men" Don't Enjoy Anal Stimulation

**Reality**: Masculinity is not defined by which body parts one enjoys having stimulated. The prostate is a normal part of male anatomy designed to respond to touch.

**Facts**:
- Masculinity exists in many forms
- Sexual preferences are personal choices
- Anatomical responses are natural and normal
- Cultural definitions of masculinity continue to evolve
