Anal sex (and sexuality in general) is a field that sometimes lacks scientific evidence, making it difficult to draw rational conclusions due to insufficient evidence or arguments based on logical fallacies. While this guide will include some scientific facts, a large amount of the information comes from the experiences of various developersâ€”methods that people have successfully used and shared, but that often lack scientific backing. At the same time, the sources of information may be subject to survivorship bias, making absolute truths difficult to ascertain. This guide will attempt to explain some methods and their potential effectiveness, but it is ultimately up to the reader to decide what to believe. This guide should be considered a compilation of various personal experiences, and the reader must use their own judgment on how to apply this information and consider any potential logical fallacies.
