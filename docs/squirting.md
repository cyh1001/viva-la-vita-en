# Squirting: Introduction

This series of articles introduces you to male and female squirting development methods.

**Note:** ① In this series of articles, the concepts "squirting" (喷水), "female ejaculation" (潮吹), and "gushing" (潮喷) are **consistent** by default, all referred to as "squirting", while concepts like "incontinence" (失禁) and "urination" (喷尿) will be **discussed separately in the following articles and are not necessarily the same**.

② By default, the prostate is directly referred to by its name, while Skene's glands are called "g-spot", and by default prostate (**male**) = g-spot + uterus (**female**)

The specific types of squirting fluids will be explained later in "Masturbation and Orgasm"
